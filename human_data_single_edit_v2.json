        "agent_updated_section": "The LCA programme originated in the early 1980s. In 1983, the Government of India established the LCA project with the initial goal to develop a new light combat aircraft to replace the ageing IAF fighters, especially the MiG-21 variants, which had been the mainstay of the IAF since 1963. At one point the IAF had operated as many as 874 MiG-21s. The \"Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981\" noted that most of these IAF fighters were approaching the end of their service lives by the early-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would be 40 percent short of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the Government of India established Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under the aegis of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to manage the LCA programme. The ADA was entrusted with the design and development of LCA while HAL was chosen as the principal contractor. The government's \"self-reliance\" goals for the LCA included the three most sophisticated and challenging systems: the Fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system, multi-mode pulse-doppler radar, and afterburning turbofan engine.\n\nThe project definition phase was commenced in October 1986 with France's Dassault-Breguet Aviation as consultant. Dassault-Breguet's expertise was mainly utilised in the design and system integration of the Tejas. In 1988, Dassault offered a hybrid fly by wire flight control system for the LCA, consisting of three digital channels and one analogue channel, with a redundant analogue channel as a back up in case the digital channels fails. But the ADA was in favour of a quadruplex digital FBW flight control system.\n\nThe design of the Tejas was finalised in 1990 as a small tailless compound delta wing design with relaxed static stability. To provide enhanced manoeuvrability it would be a control configured vehicle incorporating a digital FBW flight control system. Kota Harinarayana was the Programme Director and Chief Designer of Tejas. In 1992, a dedicated National Control Law (CLAW) team was set up by the National Aerospace Laboratories to develop India's own state of the art FBW flight control system for the Tejas. Initially Lockheed Martin's consultancy was sought. But it was terminated following a US embargo in response to India's second nuclear tests in 1998. This delayed the programme partly by about 18 months. Later India indigenously developed a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system for Tejas.\n\nThe CLAW team completed the design and integration of the flight control laws with the flight control system software, with the aid of an Iron Bird test rig. The quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system conducted over 50 hours of pilot testing on Iron Bird Test Rig. On 4 January 2001, on its maiden flight, the TD-1 successfully flew with an indigenous quadruplex digital FBW flight control system. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories' 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.\n\nAnother critical technology needed for LCA was the multi-mode radar (MMR). Initially, the Ericsson/Ferranti PS-05/A I/J-band multi-function radar, also used on Saab's JAS 39 Gripen, was intended to be used. However, DRDO decided to develop an indigenous multi-mode radar for the Tejas. HAL's Hyderabad division and the DRDO's Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) laboratory were selected to jointly lead the MMR programme, and work commenced in 1997. The Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) was responsible for the MMR's test programme. An HAL-748 airborne surveillance aircraft was converted for this purpose. The development of multi-mode was not smooth, as it suffered some setbacks. By 2005, only two radar modes \u2013 the air-to-air look-up and look-down - were confirmed to have been successfully tested. The performance of several other modes that had been tested were suboptimal. The problem with the radar was mainly attributed to the lack of compatibility between the LRDE/HAL multi mode radar and the LRDE's advanced signal processor module. Using an \"off-the-shelf\" foreign radar as an interim option was considered.\n\nADA met with success in the development of three of the five key technologies identified at the beginning of the LCA programme. The successful endeavours were mastery in the FBW flight control system, the development and manufacturing of carbon-fibre composite structures and skins, and a modern glass cockpit. The Autolay computer-aided design software developed as part of the LCA programme has been licensed to Airbus for its A380 wide-body aircraft project. The development of a multi-mode pulse-doppler radar was abandoned, off the shelf Israeli Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode and EL/M-2052 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar units being selected for the Mk1 and initial Mk1a aircraft, respectively, while DRDO opted, in 2012, to develop its own Uttam AESA Radar, as of 2024 the Uttam radar is undergoing flight trials. India's self-reliance goal oriented development for the LCA programme has considerably increased the indigenous components in Tejas and contributed to an aviation industry expansion in the country.\n\nOn 20 December 2021, Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a written reply during winter session of Rajya Sabha clarified that the HAL Tejas is no longer considered as a replacement for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, instead it is now part of a general IAF fleet modernisation programme. In December 2024, the Ministry of Defence formed a high-level committee led by the defence secretary, including senior officials, the DRDO chairman, and IAF officers, to address the IAF's critical shortage of fighter jets, which had fallen to 31 squadrons against a sanctioned strength of 42. The committee was tasked with recommending measures such as accelerating indigenous production of aircraft like the HAL Tejas and exploring foreign collaborations, with a report expected within two to three months.",

In 1983, the Government of India established the LCA project with the initial goal to develop a new light combat aircraft to replace the ageing IAF fighters, especially the MiG-21 variants, which had been the mainstay of the IAF since 1963. At one point the IAF had operated as many as 874 MiG-21s. The \"Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981\" noted that most of these IAF fighters were approaching the end of their service lives by the early-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would be 40 percent short of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the Government of India established Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under the aegis of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to manage the LCA programme. The ADA was entrusted with the design and development of LCA while HAL was chosen as the principal contractor. The government's \"self-reliance\" goals for the LCA included the three most sophisticated and challenging systems: the Fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system, multi-mode pulse-doppler radar, and afterburning turbofan engine.\n\nThe project definition phase was commenced in October 1986 with France's Dassault-Breguet Aviation as consultant. Dassault-Breguet's expertise was mainly utilised in the design and system integration of the Tejas. In 1988, Dassault offered a hybrid fly by wire flight control system for the LCA, consisting of three digital channels and one analogue channel, with a redundant analogue channel as a back up in case the digital channels fails. But the ADA was in favour of a quadruplex digital FBW flight control system.\n\nThe design of the Tejas was finalised in 1990 as a small tailless compound delta wing design with relaxed static stability. To provide enhanced manoeuvrability it would be a control configured vehicle incorporating a digital FBW flight control system. Kota Harinarayana was the Programme Director and Chief Designer of Tejas. In 1992, a dedicated National Control Law (CLAW) team was set up by the National Aerospace Laboratories to develop India's own state of the art FBW flight control system for the Tejas. Initially Lockheed Martin's consultancy was sought. But it was terminated following a US embargo in response to India's second nuclear tests in 1998. This delayed the programme partly by about 18 months. Later India indigenously developed a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system for Tejas.\n\nThe CLAW team completed the design and integration of the flight control laws with the flight control system software, with the aid of an Iron Bird test rig. The quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system conducted over 50 hours of pilot testing on Iron Bird Test Rig. On 4 January 2001, on its maiden flight, the TD-1 successfully flew with an indigenous quadruplex digital FBW flight control system. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories' 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.\n\nAnother critical technology needed for LCA was the multi-mode radar (MMR). Initially, the Ericsson/Ferranti PS-05/A I/J-band multi-function radar, also used on Saab's JAS 39 Gripen, was intended to be used. However, DRDO decided to develop an indigenous multi-mode radar for the Tejas. HAL's Hyderabad division and the DRDO's Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) laboratory were selected to jointly lead the MMR programme, and work commenced in 1997. The Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) was responsible for the MMR's test programme. An HAL-748 airborne surveillance aircraft was converted for this purpose. The development of multi-mode was not smooth, as it suffered some setbacks. By 2005, only two radar modes \u2013 the air-to-air look-up and look-down - were confirmed to have been successfully tested. The performance of several other modes that had been tested were suboptimal. The problem with the radar was mainly attributed to the lack of compatibility between the LRDE/HAL multi mode radar and the LRDE's advanced signal processor module. Using an \"off-the-shelf\" foreign radar as an interim option was considered.\n\nADA met with success in the development of three of the five key technologies identified at the beginning of the LCA programme. The successful endeavours were mastery in the FBW flight control system, the development and manufacturing of carbon-fibre composite structures and skins, and a modern glass cockpit. The Autolay computer-aided design software developed as part of the LCA programme has been licensed to Airbus for its A380 wide-body aircraft project. The development of a multi-mode pulse-doppler radar was abandoned, off the shelf Israeli Elta EL/M-2032 multi-mode and EL/M-2052 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar units being selected for the Mk1 and initial Mk1a aircraft, respectively, while DRDO opted, in 2012, to develop its own Uttam AESA Radar, as of 2024 the Uttam radar is undergoing flight trials. India's self-reliance goal oriented development for the LCA programme has considerably increased the indigenous components in Tejas and contributed to an aviation industry expansion in the country.\n\nOn 20 December 2021, Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a written reply during winter session of Rajya Sabha clarified that the HAL Tejas is no longer considered as a replacement for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, instead it is now part of a general IAF fleet modernisation programme.<ins> In December 2024, the Ministry of Defence formed a high-level committee led by the defence secretary, including senior officials, the DRDO chairman, and IAF officers, to address the IAF's critical shortage of fighter jets, which had fallen to 31 squadrons against a sanctioned strength of 42.

The delivery was scheduled to start on 3 February 2024, and was supposed to be finished in nine years. Initially, the delay of delivery date moved to March 2024.\n\nHowever, as of March 2024, the IAF's latest requests for software upgrades and minor design changes caused the delay in delivery timeline, as per to sources within the military and defence establishment. Also, a number of certifications were pending. The delivery of essential components that were ordered from Israel, Russia and Ukraine have also been delayed due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. All of which is impacting the production and delivery schedule.\n\nAccording to reports, Ministry of Defence has asked HAL to deliver 18 Tejas Mk 1A by March 2024 and all of 180 jets within 10 years. This was necessary to negate out the shortfall in IAF's combat squadron which is much below the sanctioned squadron strength of IAF. As per Ministry of Defence, there is a delay of more than 10 months in supply of F404-GE-IN20 engines by GE Aerospace.\n\nNo. 3 Squadron, followed by No. 23 Squadron, will be the first to operate the Mk 1A variant.\n\nSubsequently, the delivery dates were shifted several times from February 2024 to July-end (as of May), to 15 August (as of July) while the delivery of GE F404 engines was expected to start by September\u2013October in 2024 at the rate of up to two engines per month.\n\nAs of August, the delivery dates were again shifted to November 2024. While the first aircraft is undergoing critical flight tests and weapons trials are expected soon, the second is in high speed taxi trials phase. The next 4 units are in advanced stages of production. In fact, HAL has plans to manufacture at least 14 airframes in \"ready-to-go state\" by this fiscal year. It would take few weeks to integrate the engine into the airframe and deliver it to IAF after the start of engine delivery.\n\nAs reported in September 2024, Denmark has prohibited the export of engine charge amplifiers, which were earlier installed on Tejas Mk1, resulting in further delays in Tejas Mk 1A delivery. As a solution, HAL has assigned a Bengaluru-based company to indigenise the component. HAL is to begin testing of the component soon after its development. The engine charge amplifier is a crucial component tasked to sense engine temperature and adjust operation accordingly.\n\nAgain in September, it was reported that the Tejas Mk1A will be delivered from October 2024, as the fighter aircraft's Israeli software integration being finished and is undergoing final trials. The delivery will begin with the category B engines, which refers to previously used or procured from GE. The F404-IN20 engine delivery has been shifted to arrive in November 2024.\n\nAs of October 2024, GE again delayed the delivery of first F404-IN20 engines until April 2025. These delays are attributed to supply chains as a South Korean firm with financial issues are unable to deliver certain components of the engine. This subsequently pushed the delivery date of first Mk1A until mid-2025. HAL has 5-6 aircraft ready for delivery. However, the primary constraint is the GE engines. India has no plans to impose penalties on GE for the delays. The Mk1A is in the final stages of trials before delivery.\n\nAs of late December, reports suggest that further critical trials of Tejas Mk1A using Category B F404 engines is to commence in January 2025 as a part of a contingency plan. The new deadline set for delivery of first aircraft is 31 March 2025. The Category B F404 engines are to be replaced once the new engines are delivered. The trials will also include Astra Mk1 air-to-air beyond visual range missiles, EL/M-2052 and indigenous Electronic Warfare Suite (radar warning receiver and advanced self-protection jammer). The aircraft will be delivered after certain certifications are done.\n\nIt was reported that the production line of GE F404 engines at Boston has been started and first units could be delivered by March 2025. GE had a timeline to deliver 6 engines in 2023-24. However, the F404 production line at Lynn, Massachusetts had been closed and led to supply chain problems during COVID-19 pandemic. These problems have been resolved. Initially, one or two engines will be delivered per month while the rate will be stabilised by 2026 after which, the delivery rate will be 24 aircraft per year and is to be enhanced to 30 units later.\n\nAs of 10 January 2025, GE had a backlog of 26 engines, while the delivery deadline of the engines and aircraft remained unchanged. The first aircraft from Nashik production line is expected to roll out in March as well. HAL also plans to setup another production line at Nashik to ramp up production capacity from 24 to 32.\n\nAs of 6 February 2025, HAL had three Tejas Mk1A aircraft \u201cready in the flight line\u201d while five of them are scheduled to be ready by March-April. These aircraft can be delivered within few days once GE starts engine deliveries by March. Integration of EW Suite and radars are complete while trials of Astra missiles form these jets are expected soon. GE has \"promised\" to deliver 12 engines in 2025-26 starting in March 2025 with 20 engines to be delivered from 2026-27 onwards. Tejas delivery rate will depend on the revised engine delivery schedules. Meanwhile, Nashik line is reportedly operational and the first Tejas Mk1A is planned to roll out in one or two months. Secretary of Defence Production Sanjeev Kumar stated during Aero India 2025 that Tejas' production line has stabilized, both with HAL and GE engines, and that Tejas' supply will follow the original plan starting in 2025\u20132026.\n\nIn February 2025, HAL Chairman D.

As per Ministry of Defence, there is a delay of more than 10 months in supply of F404-GE-IN20 engines by GE Aerospace.\n\nNo. 3 Squadron, followed by No. 23 Squadron, will be the first to operate the Mk 1A variant.\n\nSubsequently, the delivery dates were shifted several times from February 2024 to July-end (as of May), to 15 August (as of July) while the delivery of GE F404 engines was expected to start by September\u2013October in 2024 at the rate of up to two engines per month.\n\nAs of August, the delivery dates were again shifted to November 2024. While the first aircraft is undergoing critical flight tests and weapons trials are expected soon, the second is in high speed taxi trials phase. The next 4 units are in advanced stages of production. In fact, HAL has plans to manufacture at least 14 airframes in \"ready-to-go state\" by this fiscal year. It would take few weeks to integrate the engine into the airframe and deliver it to IAF after the start of engine delivery.\n\nAs reported in September 2024, Denmark has prohibited the export of engine charge amplifiers, which were earlier installed on Tejas Mk1, resulting in further delays in Tejas Mk 1A delivery. As a solution, HAL has assigned a Bengaluru-based company to indigenise the component. HAL is to begin testing of the component soon after its development. The engine charge amplifier is a crucial component tasked to sense engine temperature and adjust operation accordingly.\n\nAgain in September, it was reported that the Tejas Mk1A will be delivered from October 2024, as the fighter aircraft's Israeli software integration being finished and is undergoing final trials. The delivery will begin with the category B engines, which refers to previously used or procured from GE. The F404-IN20 engine delivery has been shifted to arrive in November 2024.\n\nAs of October 2024, GE again delayed the delivery of first F404-IN20 engines until April 2025. These delays are attributed to supply chains as a South Korean firm with financial issues are unable to deliver certain components of the engine. This subsequently pushed the delivery date of first Mk1A until mid-2025. HAL has 5-6 aircraft ready for delivery. However, the primary constraint is the GE engines. India has no plans to impose penalties on GE for the delays. The Mk1A is in the final stages of trials before delivery.\n\nAs of late December, reports suggest that further critical trials of Tejas Mk1A using Category B F404 engines is to commence in January 2025 as a part of a contingency plan. The new deadline set for delivery of first aircraft is 31 March 2025. The Category B F404 engines are to be replaced once the new engines are delivered. The trials will also include Astra Mk1 air-to-air beyond visual range missiles, EL/M-2052 and indigenous Electronic Warfare Suite (radar warning receiver and advanced self-protection jammer). The aircraft will be delivered after certain certifications are done.\n\nIt was reported that the production line of GE F404 engines at Boston has been started and first units could be delivered by March 2025. GE had a timeline to deliver 6 engines in 2023-24. However, the F404 production line at Lynn, Massachusetts had been closed and led to supply chain problems during COVID-19 pandemic. These problems have been resolved. Initially, one or two engines will be delivered per month while the rate will be stabilised by 2026 after which, the delivery rate will be 24 aircraft per year and is to be enhanced to 30 units later.\n\nAs of 10 January 2025, GE had a backlog of 26 engines, while the delivery deadline of the engines and aircraft remained unchanged. The first aircraft from Nashik production line is expected to roll out in March as well. HAL also plans to setup another production line at Nashik to ramp up production capacity from 24 to 32.\n\nAs of 6 February 2025, HAL had three Tejas Mk1A <del> </del>aircraft \u201cready in the flight line\u201d while five of them are scheduled to be ready by March-April. These aircraft can be delivered within few days once GE starts engine deliveries by March. Integration of EW Suite and radars are complete while trials of Astra missiles form these jets are expected soon. GE has \"promised\" to deliver 12 engines in 2025-26 starting in March 2025 with 20 engines to be delivered from 2026-27 onwards. Tejas delivery rate will depend on the revised engine delivery schedules. Meanwhile, Nashik line is reportedly operational and the first Tejas Mk1A is planned to roll out in one or two months. Secretary of Defence Production Sanjeev Kumar stated during Aero India 2025 that Tejas' production line has stabilized, both with HAL and GE engines, and that Tejas' supply will follow the original plan starting in 2025\u20132026.",

The delivery was scheduled to start on 3 February 2024, and was supposed to be finished in nine years. Initially, the delay of delivery date moved to March 2024.\n\nHowever, as of March 2024, the IAF's latest requests for software upgrades and minor design changes caused the delay in delivery timeline, as per to sources within the military and defence establishment.

On October 17, Netflix launched Profile Transfer to help end account sharing.\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Netflix announced plans to launch an advertising-supported subscription option. Netflix's planned advertising tier would not allow subscribers to download content like the existing ad-free platform. On July 20, 2022, it was announced that the advertising-supported tier would be coming to Netflix in 2023 but it would not feature the full library of content. In October, the launch date was announced as November 3, 2022, and was launched in 12 countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Japan and South Korea.

In May 2023, these measures were further expanded to United States and Brazil subscribers.\n\nIn July 2023, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers for the second quarter of the year for a total of 238.39 million subscribers overall. The United States and Canada accounted for 1.2 million subscribers which was the largest regional quarterly gain since 2021.\n\nNetflix announced in February that it was going to enforce stricter regulations for password sharing. In May 2023, Netflix began cracking down on password-sharing in the US, UK, and Australia. Under these new rules, multiple people can use and share one account, but they have to be under the same household. Netflix defines a household as people who live in the same location as the owner of the account. Users are asked to set a primary location based on the device's IP address.\n\nNetflix reported 8.05 million new subscribers in Q2 2024, up from 5.9 million subscribers added in Q2 2023.\n\nIn July 2024, Netflix started phasing out its cheapest subscription plan for users in France and the US, a year after the plan was removed for Canada and the UK.

Netflix also introduced a new Extra Member with Ads plan for an additional $6.99 per month, allowing subscribers to add an ad-supported membership for someone outside their household, while raising the price of the ad-free extra member plan to $8.99. The company reported adding 19 million new subscribers in a single quarter, reaching a global total of 300 million subscribers, marking the largest quarterly subscriber growth in its history.

The proclamation was also read out by local authorities around the United Kingdom. Other realms signed and read their own proclamations, as did Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the British Overseas Territories, the Crown Dependencies, Canadian provinces, and Australian states.\n\n\nCharles and Camilla's coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023. Plans had been made for many years, under the code name Operation Golden Orb. Reports before his accession suggested that Charles's coronation would be simpler than his mother's in 1953, with the ceremony expected to be \"shorter, smaller, less expensive, and more representative of different faiths and community groupsfalling in line with the King's wish to reflect the ethnic diversity of modern Britain\".;  Nonetheless, the coronation was a Church of England rite, including the coronation oath, the anointment, delivery of the orb, and enthronement. In July that year, the royal couple attended a national service of thanksgiving where Charles was presented with the Honours of Scotland in St Giles' Cathedral.\n\nIn July 2023, Charles asked for the profits from Britain's growing fleet of offshore windfarms to be used for the \"wider public good\" rather than as extra funding for the monarchy. It was announced that the funding of the monarchy would be reduced to 12 per\u00a0cent of the Crown Estate's net profits.\n\nIn November 2022, the King and Queen hosted the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, during the first official state visit to Britain of Charles III's reign. In March the following year, the King and Queen embarked on a state visit to Germany; Charles became the first British monarch to address the Bundestag. Similarly, in September, he became the first British monarch to give a speech from France's Senate chamber during his state visit to the country. The following month, Charles visited Kenya where he faced pressure to apologise for British colonial actions. In a speech at the state banquet, he acknowledged \"abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence\", but did not formally apologise.\n\n\nIn May 2024, the British prime minister Rishi Sunak asked the King to call a general election; subsequently royal engagements which could divert attention from the election campaign were postponed. In June 2024, Charles and Camilla travelled to Normandy to attend the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day. The same month, he received Emperor Naruhito of Japan during the latter's state visit to the United Kingdom. In July the annual Holyrood Week, which is usually spent in Scotland, was shortened so that Charles could return to London and appoint a new prime minister following the general election. After Sunak's Conservatives lost the election to the Labour Party led by Sir Keir Starmer, Charles appointed Starmer as prime minister.\n\n\nIn October 2024, the King and Queen toured Australia and Samoa; Australia was the first overseas Commonwealth realm he visited since his accession. In Samoa, Charles attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time as head of the Commonwealth. The tour was significantly scaled back owing to his cancer diagnosis, a planned visit to New Zealand being among the cancelled events. Charles temporarily paused cancer treatment during the tour.\n\n</del>In March 2025 Charles received Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at Sandringham House.

It is one of the world's largest social media platforms and one of the most-visited websites. Users can share short text messages, images, and videos in short posts commonly known as \"tweets\" (officially \"posts\") and like other users' content. The platform also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling, bookmarks, lists, communities, a chatbot (Grok), job search, and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by approved users using the Community Notes feature.\n\nTwitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, and was launched in July of that year. Twitter grew quickly; by 2012 more than 100 million users produced 340 million daily tweets. Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world. A signature characteristic of the service initially was that posts were required to be brief. Posts were initially limited to 140 characters, which was changed to 280 characters in 2017. The limitation was removed for subscribed accounts in 2023. 10% of users produce over 80% of tweets. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were run by internet bots rather than humans.\n\nThe service is owned by the American company X Corp., which was established to succeed the prior owner Twitter, Inc. in March 2023 following the October 2022 acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk for $43 billion. Musk stated that his goal with the acquisition was to promote free speech on the platform. Since his acquisition, the platform has been criticized for enabling the increased spread of disinformation and hate speech. Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as the chairman and the chief technology officer. In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded to \"X\" and the bird logo would be retired, a process which was completed by May 2024. As of early 2024, X had approximately 429 million global users, with the largest user bases in the United States, Japan, and India. The platform's revenue declined to $2.5 billion in 2024 from a peak of $5 billion in 2021, with advertising revenue dropping significantly. Since Musk's takeover, data from app-tracking firms has shown that global usage of Twitter has declined by approximately 15%, compared to a decline of 5\u201310% in some other social media sites. The platform has disputed that usage has dropped at all, with Musk saying that membership had grown to 600 million users. By October 2024, the platform was estimated to have lost about 72 percent of its value since Musk acquired it. Despite the rebranding, many users still refer to the platform as Twitter, and the blue bird logo remains culturally significant.",

He previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2020 to 2024. He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Holborn and St Pancras since 2015, and was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013.\n\nBorn in London and raised in Surrey, Starmer attended Reigate Grammar School. He was active politically as a teenager, and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds in 1985 and received a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford where he was a student at St Edmund Hall in 1986. After being called to the Bar, Starmer practised predominantly in criminal defence work, specialising in human rights. He served as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board, taking silk as a Queen's Counsel in 2002. During his tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions and Head of the Crown Prosecution Service he dealt with a number of major cases, including the Stephen Lawrence murder case. In the 2014 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) for \"services to law and criminal justice\".\n\nStarmer's policing work in Northern Ireland influenced him to pursue a political career, and he was elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election. He supported the Remain campaign in the 2016 European Union membership referendum and advocated a proposed second referendum on Brexit. He served in Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Brexit Secretary, and following Corbyn's resignation after Labour's defeat at the 2019 general election, Starmer succeeded him by winning the 2020 leadership election. As Leader of the Opposition he moved Labour towards the political centre and emphasised the elimination of antisemitism within the party, and his party made significant gains in the 2023 and 2024 local elections. Starmer oversaw a significant drop in Labour membership in the years leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nStarmer led Labour to a landslide victory at the 2024 general election, ending fourteen years of Conservative Party governance, though with the smallest electoral vote share of any majority government since record-keeping of the popular vote began in 1830. Under Starmer's premiership the government has ended certain winter fuel payments for around 10 million people, implemented an early-release scheme for thousands of prisoners to decrease prison overcrowding, and settled a number of public-sector strikes. Starmer has announced the Border Security Command in replacement of the Rwanda asylum plan and a National Violent Disorder Programme in response to the 2024 riots, as well as reforms to workers' rights. In foreign policy, he has supported Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel in the Israel-Hamas war, whilst also calling for a ceasefire. In February 2025, Starmer became the first British Prime Minister to attend a European Union leaders' meeting since Brexit, seeking to rebuild UK-EU relations, manage trade tensions with the United States, and strengthen cooperation on security and sanctions against Russia, while ruling out rejoining the EU customs union or single market.",

In May 2022, Starmer said he would resign were he to receive a fixed penalty notice for breaching COVID-19 regulations while campaigning during the run-up to the Hartlepool by-election and local elections the previous year. The controversy surrounding the event was dubbed \"beergate\". In July 2022 Durham Police cleared Starmer and said that he had \"no case to answer\".

In October 2020, following the release of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)'s report into antisemitism in the Labour Party, Starmer accepted its findings in full and apologised to Jews on the Party's behalf. In February 2023 Starmer's antisemitism reforms resulted in the Labour Party no longer being monitored by the EHRC. During Starmer's tenure as leader, Labour saw a drop in party membership from a peak of 532,000 after the 2019 election to 370,450 in the runup to the 2024 election. More than 20,000 members left the party within two months in 2024, with blame placed on the party's stance on the Gazan genocide and green investment. In early 2025, Labour faced criticism over national insurance tax hikes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, which led to an average 10% increase in nursery fees and put many childcare providers at risk of closure. The resulting childcare funding crisis became a significant domestic policy challenge and point of public and political debate during Starmer's leadership.",

During Starmer's tenure as leader, Labour saw a drop in party membership from a peak of 532,000 after the 2019 election to 370,450 in the runup to the 2024 election. More than 20,000 members left the party within two months in 2024, with blame placed on the party's stance on the Gazan genocide and green investment.<ins> In early 2025, Labour faced criticism over national insurance tax hikes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, which led to an average 10% increase in nursery fees and put many childcare providers at risk of closure. The resulting childcare funding crisis became a significant domestic policy challenge and point of public and political debate during Starmer's leadership.</ins>",

            "Apr 03, 2025"
        ],
        "agent_updated_section": "Starmer's political positions have changed since the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, which he won on a ten-pledge left-leaning platform. Most of these pledges, including increasing income tax on top 5 per cent of earners, the abolition of university tuition fees, nationalisation of public services including water and energy, and support for freedom of movement, were scrapped or watered down during Starmer's tenure as Labour and Opposition leader. Starmer has defended this by saying the changing economic circumstances made these pledges unviable.\n\nSome commentators, judging that Starmer has led his party towards the political centre in order to improve its electability, attempt to liken what he has accomplished in this regard with Tony Blair's development of New Labour. Others regard his changes of policy as testament that Starmer holds no clearly-defined philosophy. A third group think that Starmer does subscribe to a definite ideology and that it is towards the left end of the socialist spectrum, arguing that \"Labour under Starmer has advanced a politics of anti-neoliberalism like that of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell\", and that Starmer \"differs markedly from New Labour\" in \"aspiring to restructure an economic model perceived to have failed\". Figures including Starmer's former boss \u2013 the barrister Geoffrey Robertson \u2013 his former advisor Simon Fletcher, and the journalist and broadcaster Peter Oborne, have described Starmer as exhibiting an authoritarian approach. Despite the lack of consensus as yet about the character and even existence of Starmer's ideology, it has acquired a neologism, Starmerism, and his supporters have been called Starmerites.\n\nIn April 2023, Starmer gave an interview to The Economist on defining Starmerism. In this interview, two main strands of Starmerism were identified. The first strand focused on a critique of the British state for being too ineffective and over-centralised. The answer to this critique was to base governance on five main missions to be followed over two terms of government: these missions would determine all government policy. The second strand was the adherence to an economic policy of \"modern supply-side economics\" based on expanding economic productivity by increasing participation in the labour market, reducing inequality, expanding skills, mitigating the impact of Brexit and simplifying the construction planning process. In June 2023 Starmer gave an interview to Time where he was asked to define Starmerism, stating: \"Recognizing that our economy needs to be fixed. Recognizing that [solving] climate change isn't just an obligation; it's the single biggest opportunity that we've got for our country going forward. Recognizing that public services need to be reformed, that every child and every place should have the best opportunities and that we need a safe environment, safe streets, et cetera.\" In April 2025, during the Labour local elections campaign launch, Starmer described President Trump's tariff policies as the beginning of a \"new era\" in global trade and economics, emphasizing the need for the UK to adapt its economic policies to this changing context. He instructed his team to accelerate efforts to build economic resilience, and maintained that the UK should not have to choose between the US and Europe, signaling a nuanced approach to trade and economic relations.\n\nStarmer has repeatedly emphasised the reform of public institutions (against a tax and spend approach), localism, and devolution. He has pledged to abolish the House of Lords, which he describes as \"indefensible\", during the first term of a Labour government and to replace it with a directly-elected Assembly of the Regions and Nations, the details of which will be subject to scrutiny by public consultation. He criticised the Conservatives for creating peerages for \"cronies and donors\". Starmer tasked former PM Gordon Brown with recommending British constitutional reforms, whose report was published in 2022. Endorsed and promoted by Starmer, Brown's report recommended the abolition of the House of Lords, extending greater powers to local councils and mayors, and deeper devolution to the countries of the United Kingdom. Labour's 2024 election manifesto committed to the removal of the remaining hereditary peers from the chamber, setting a mandatory retirement age of 80, and beginning a consultation on replacing the Lords with a \"more representative\" body. Starmer strongly favours green policies to tackle climate change and decarbonise the British economy. He has committed to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK electricity grid by 2030.\n\nIn a July 2024 statement to PinkNews ahead of the 2024 election, Starmer stated the Labour Party supported LGBT rights, including strengthening protections against hate crimes targeting members of the LGBT community, \"modernising\" the \"intrusive and outdated\" gender recognition framework, and a proposed, \"trans-inclusive\" ban on conversion therapy. Starmer has ruled out allowing transgender people to self-identify, has stated that trans women should not have the right to use women-only spaces, and has also said he will continue the block on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill in Scotland. After taking office, the Labour Party announced a fully trans-inclusive conversion therapy ban. After the murder of George Floyd by the police officer Derek Chauvin in the United States, against which numerous protests were held in the Western world, Starmer supported the Black Lives Matter movement, and took the knee alongside his deputy, Angela Rayner. One year on from Floyd's murder, Starmer promised a Race Equality Act, which he said would be a \"defining cause\" for his Labour Government.\n\nIn the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021, Starmer called for longer sentences for rape and sexual violence. Starmer said he wanted to reduce crime, maintaining that \"too many people do not feel safe in their streets\". He has pledged to halve the rates of violence against women and girls, halve the rates of serious violent crime, halve the incidents of knife crime, increase confidence in the criminal justice system, and create a 'Charging Commission'www.the-independent.com which would be \"tasked with coming up with reforms to reverse the decline in the number of offences being solved\". He has also committed to placing specialist domestic violence workers in the control rooms of every police force responding to 999 calls to support victims of abuse. Starmer said that Blair's era of New Labour was right to be \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". In June 2024 Starmer pledged to reduce the record high level of legal immigration to the UK, and aims to reduce net migration by improving training and skills for British workers.\n\nIn December 2023, Starmer used Margaret Thatcher, as well as Tony Blair and Clement Attlee, as examples of how politicians can effect \"meaningful change\" by acting \"in service of the British people, rather than dictating to them\". Starmer has described the Labour Party as \"deeply patriotic\" and credits its most successful leaders, Attlee, Harold Wilson, and Blair, for policies \"rooted in the everyday concerns of working people\".

Most of these pledges, including increasing income tax on top 5 per cent of earners, the abolition of university tuition fees, nationalisation of public services including water and energy, and support for freedom of movement, were scrapped or watered down during Starmer's tenure as Labour and Opposition leader. Starmer has defended this by saying the changing economic circumstances made these pledges unviable.\n\nSome commentators, judging that Starmer has led his party towards the political centre in order to improve its electability, attempt to liken what he has accomplished in this regard with Tony Blair's development of New Labour. Others regard his changes of policy as testament that Starmer holds no clearly-defined philosophy. A third group think that Starmer does subscribe to a definite ideology and that it is towards the left end of the socialist spectrum, arguing that \"Labour under Starmer has advanced a politics of anti-neoliberalism like that of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell\", and that Starmer \"differs markedly from New Labour\" in \"aspiring to restructure an economic model perceived to have failed\". Figures including Starmer's former boss \u2013 the barrister Geoffrey Robertson \u2013 his former advisor Simon Fletcher, and the journalist and broadcaster Peter Oborne, have described Starmer as exhibiting an authoritarian approach. Despite the lack of consensus as yet about the character and even existence of Starmer's ideology, it has acquired a neologism, Starmerism, and his supporters have been called Starmerites.\n\n\nIn April 2023, Starmer gave an interview to The Economist on defining Starmerism. In this interview, two main strands of Starmerism were identified. The first strand focused on a critique of the British state for being too ineffective and over-centralised. The answer to this critique was to base governance on five main missions to be followed over two terms of government: these missions would determine all government policy. The second strand was the adherence to an economic policy of \"modern supply-side economics\" based on expanding economic productivity by increasing participation in the labour market, reducing inequality, expanding skills, mitigating the impact of Brexit and simplifying the construction planning process. In June 2023 Starmer gave an interview to Time where he was asked to define Starmerism, stating: \"Recognizing that our economy needs to be fixed. Recognizing that [solving] climate change isn't just an obligation; it's the single biggest opportunity that we've got for our country going forward. Recognizing that public services need to be reformed, that every child and every place should have the best opportunities and that we need a safe environment, safe streets, et cetera.\"\n\n\nStarmer has repeatedly emphasised the reform of public institutions (against a tax and spend approach), localism, and devolution. He has pledged to abolish the House of Lords, which he describes as \"indefensible\", during the first term of a Labour government and to replace it with a directly-elected Assembly of the Regions and Nations, the details of which will be subject to scrutiny by public consultation. He criticised the Conservatives for creating peerages for \"cronies and donors\". Starmer tasked former PM Gordon Brown with recommending British constitutional reforms, whose report was published in 2022. Endorsed and promoted by Starmer, Brown's report recommended the abolition of the House of Lords, extending greater powers to local councils and mayors, and deeper devolution to the countries of the United Kingdom. Labour's 2024 election manifesto committed to the removal of the remaining hereditary peers from the chamber, setting a mandatory retirement age of 80, and beginning a consultation on replacing the Lords with a \"more representative\" body. Starmer strongly favours green policies to tackle climate change and decarbonise the British economy. He has committed to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK electricity grid by 2030.\n\nIn a July 2024 statement to PinkNews ahead of the 2024 election, Starmer stated the Labour Party supported LGBT rights, including strengthening protections against hate crimes targeting members of the LGBT community, \"modernising\" the \"intrusive and outdated\" gender recognition framework, and a proposed, \"trans-inclusive\" ban on conversion therapy. Starmer has ruled out allowing transgender people to self-identify, has stated that trans women should not have the right to use women-only spaces, and has also said he will continue the block on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill in Scotland. After taking office, the Labour Party announced a fully trans-inclusive conversion therapy ban. After the murder of George Floyd by the police officer Derek Chauvin in the United States, against which numerous protests were held in the Western world, Starmer supported the Black Lives Matter movement, and took the knee alongside his deputy, Angela Rayner. One year on from Floyd's murder, Starmer promised a Race Equality Act, which he said would be a \"defining cause\" for his Labour Government.\n\nIn the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021, Starmer called for longer sentences for rape and sexual violence. Starmer said he wanted to reduce crime, maintaining that \"too many people do not feel safe in their streets\". He has pledged to halve the rates of violence against women and girls, halve the rates of serious violent crime, halve the incidents of knife crime, increase confidence in the criminal justice system, and create a 'Charging Commission'www.the-independent.com which would be \"tasked with coming up with reforms to reverse the decline in the number of offences being solved\". He has also committed to placing specialist domestic violence workers in the control rooms of every police force responding to 999 calls to support victims of abuse. Starmer said that Blair's era of New Labour was right to be \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". In June 2024 Starmer pledged to reduce the record high level of legal immigration to the UK, and aims to reduce net migration by improving training and skills for British workers.\n\nIn December 2023, Starmer used Margaret Thatcher, as well as Tony Blair and Clement Attlee, as examples of how politicians can effect \"meaningful change\" by acting \"in service of the British people, rather than dictating to them\". Starmer has described the Labour Party as \"deeply patriotic\" and credits its most successful leaders, Attlee, Harold Wilson, and Blair, for policies \"rooted in the everyday concerns of working people\".

Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage.\n\nSwift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n\nShifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and switched to indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)\u2014the highest-grossing concert film. In January 2025, Travis Kelce confirmed that Swift is working on new music inspired by their relationship, hinting at multiple unreleased songs and suggesting a possible new album release in 2025.\n\nSwift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing touring artist, the first billionaire from music primarily, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30). She also received 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record four IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards.

Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic versatility, and cultural impact, Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists and has a record seven albums that each sold one million copies first-week in the US. She is the highest-grossing touring artist, the richest female musician, and the first billionaire with music as the primary source of income.\n\nSwift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", and \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n\nShifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number-one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has embarked on six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024), which became the highest-grossing tour in history, spanning 22 months with 149 concerts, 10 million spectators, and $2 billion in revenue, though three shows in Vienna were canceled due to a terrorist threat. Since the tour concluded in December 2024, Swift has largely withdrawn from the public eye, appearing only sporadically and not updating her social media since December 12, 2024. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)\u2014the highest-grossing concert film.\n\nA prominent figure in popular music, Swift has received extensive media coverage and has a global fanbase known as Swifties. Swift has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone and Billboard, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record five IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards. Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30).

She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (124 weeks); the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425); the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14), Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32), number-one debuts (7), top-ten songs (59), top-five songs (36), Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9), and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101); and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13) and Digital Songs (29). Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200; and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart. She is the third highest-certified female digital singles artist (and seventh overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond. Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.\n\nSwift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019. She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault, and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year. Rolling Stone ranked Swift at 102 on their list of 200 Best Singers of All Time in 2023. Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once. She received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.",

He came to international attention in 2010 after WikiLeaks published a series of leaks from Chelsea Manning, a United States Army intelligence analyst: footage of a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, U.S. military logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and U.S. diplomatic cables. Assange has won multiple awards for publishing and journalism.\n\nAssange was raised in various places around Australia until his family settled in Melbourne in his middle teens. He became involved in the hacker community and was convicted for hacking in 1996. Following the establishment of WikiLeaks, Assange was its editor when it published the Bank Julius Baer documents, footage of the 2008 Tibetan unrest, and a report on political killings in Kenya with The Sunday Times. Publication of the leaks from Manning started in February 2010.\n\nIn November 2010 Sweden wished to question Assange in an unrelated police investigation and sought to extradite him from the UK. In June 2012, Assange breached his bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012 on the grounds of political persecution and fears he might be extradited to the United States. In 2013, he launched the WikiLeaks Party and unsuccessfully stood for the Australian Senate. Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019.\n\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested. He was found guilty of breaching the United Kingdom Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. The U.S. government unsealed an indictment charging Assange with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion related to the leaks provided by Manning. In May 2019 and June 2020, the U.S. government unsealed new indictments against Assange, charging him with violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and alleging he had conspired with hackers. Critics have described these charges as an unprecedented challenge to press freedom with potential implications for investigative journalism worldwide. Assange was incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London from April 2019 to June 2024, as the U.S. government's extradition effort was contested in the UK courts.\n\nIn 2024, following a High Court ruling that granted Assange a full appeal to extradition, Assange and his lawyers negotiated a deal with the DOJ. Assange agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to an Espionage Act charge of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified U.S. national defence documents in return for a sentence of time served. On 26 June 2024, Assange was released from imprisonment in the UK after a 14-year campaign for his freedom, which included extensive legal battles, international activism, and support from journalist unions and global solidarity movements. Following the hearing Assange flew to Australia, arriving on 26 June.\n\nNoted documentary film director Eugene Jarecki is preparing a film about Assange, titled \"The Six Billion Dollar Man.\" It was slated for presentation at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival beginning on January 23; however, in December 2024, Jarecki decided to suspend its release, saying, \"significant recent and unexpected developments have emerged at the heart of the story which, if not incorporated in the version for Sundance, would not represent a finished film.\" No date was given for its eventual release.",

In early 2025, in his first public remarks since his release in June 2024 after 14 years of incarceration, Assange revealed that artificial intelligence had been used to conduct mass assassinations in Gaza, stating that AI targeting has blurred the lines between assassination and warfare. He emphasized the use of surveillance data from telephones and the internet in training AI algorithms for targeting, highlighting his continued focus on the intersection of AI, surveillance, and human rights.\n\nIn 2010 Assange received a deal for his autobiography worth at least US$1.3million. In 2011, Canongate Books published Julian Assange, The Unauthorised Autobiography. Assange immediately disavowed it and accused Canongate of breaching their contract by publishing, against his wishes, a draft that Assange considered \"a narrative and literary interpretation of a conversation between the writer and me\". Assange added that it was \"a work in progress\" and \"entirely uncorrected or fact-checked by me.\" In 2014, O'Hagan wrote about his experience as Assange's ghostwriter. \"The story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses\", O'Hagan recalled. \"He didn't want to do the book. He hadn't from the beginning.\" Colin Robinson, co-publisher of Assange's 2012 book Cypherpunks, criticised O'Hagan for largely ignoring the bigger issues about which Assange had been warning and noted that O'Hagan's piece \"is no part of an organised dirty tricks campaign.

According to the New York Times, in November 2010 \"Assange had mused about seeking refuge in Russia\", and Russia issued Assange a visa in January 2011.\n\nAccording to Andrew O'Hagan, during the 2011 Egyptian revolution when Mubarak tried to close the mobile phone networks, Assange and others at WikiLeaks \"hacked into Nortel and fought against Mubarak's official hackers to reverse the process\".\n\nOver the next several years, WikiLeaks published the Guantanamo Bay files leak, the Syria Files, the Kissinger cables, and the Saudi cables. As of July 2015, Assange said WikiLeaks had published more than ten million documents and associated analyses; he described it as \"a giant library of the world's most persecuted documents\".<ins> In February 2025, an anonymous donor sent over 711 ETH (nearly two million dollars) to WikiLeaks' Ethereum donation address, highlighting the organization's continued acceptance of cryptocurrency donations amid financial restrictions.</ins>",

In August 2011, WikiLeaks volunteer Sigurdur Thordarson contacted the FBI and became the first informant to work for the FBI from inside WikiLeaks. He gave the FBI several hard drives he had copied from Assange and core WikiLeaks members.\n\nIn December 2011 prosecutors in the Chelsea Manning case revealed the existence of chat logs between Manning and someone they claimed was Assange. Assange said that WikiLeaks has no way of knowing the identity of its sources and that chats with sources, including user-names, were anonymous. In January 2011, Assange described the allegation that WikiLeaks had conspired with Manning, had communicated with Manning, as \"absolute nonsense\" because WikiLeaks only learned Manning's name from media reports. The logs were presented as evidence during Manning's court-martial in June\u2013July 2013. The prosecution argued that they showed WikiLeaks helping Manning reverse-engineer a password. During her trial, Manning said she acted on her own to send documents to WikiLeaks, and no one associated with WikiLeaks pressured her into giving more information.\n\nIn 2012 diplomatic cables between Australia and the United States were released that showed the US government was investigating Assange and that \"a broad range of possible charges are under consideration, including espionage and conspiracy\". The diplomats dismissed claims the investigation was politically motivated, and highlighted prosecutors' claims that Manning was \"guided by WikiLeaks' list of 'most wanted' leaks\".\n\nIn 2013 US officials said it was unlikely that the Justice Department would indict Assange for publishing classified documents because it would also have to prosecute the news organisations and writers who published classified material. In June 2013, The New York Times said that court and other documents suggested that Assange was being examined by a grand jury and \"several government agencies\", including by the FBI. Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that WikiLeaks was under \"active and ongoing\" investigation at that time.\n\nUnder the Obama Administration, the Department of Justice did not indict Assange because it could not find evidence that his actions differed from those of a journalist. During the first Trump Administration, CIA director Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped up pursuit of Assange. Law enforcement officials wanted to learn about Assange's knowledge of WikiLeaks's interactions with Russian intelligence and other actions. They had considered offering Assange some form of immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony and had reached out to Assange's lawyers. The negotiations were ended by the Vault 7 disclosures.\n\nIn April 2017 US officials were preparing to file formal charges against Assange. Assange's indictment was unsealed in 2019 and expanded on later that year and in 2020. The legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that prosecutors likely accelerated the case in 2019 due to the impending statute of limitations on Assange's largest leaks.\n\nIn early 2019 the Mueller report wrote the Special Counsel's office considered charging WikiLeaks or Assange \"as conspirators in the computer-intrusion conspiracy\" and that there were \"factual uncertainties\" about the role that Assange may have played in the hacks or their distribution that were \"the subject of ongoing investigations\" by the US Attorney's Office.<ins>\n\nIn early 2025, new allegations surfaced that Spanish police tampered with and deleted over 17,000 emails from a hard drive containing evidence related to David Morales, a former military officer investigated for spying on Assange for the CIA. In June 2025, Assange was released after reaching a plea deal with the US Department of Justice, pleading guilty to a violation of the Espionage Act and accepting a five-year sentence already served in UK custody.</ins>",

He came to international attention in 2010 after WikiLeaks published a series of leaks from Chelsea Manning, a United States Army intelligence analyst: footage of a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, U.S. military logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and U.S. diplomatic cables. Assange has won multiple awards for publishing and journalism.\n\nAssange was raised in various places around Australia until his family settled in Melbourne in his middle teens. He became involved in the hacker community and was convicted for hacking in 1996. Following the establishment of WikiLeaks, Assange was its editor when it published the Bank Julius Baer documents, footage of the 2008 Tibetan unrest, and a report on political killings in Kenya with The Sunday Times. Publication of the leaks from Manning started in February 2010.\n\nIn November 2010 Sweden wished to question Assange in an unrelated police investigation and sought to extradite him from the UK. In June 2012, Assange breached his bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012 on the grounds of political persecution and fears he might be extradited to the United States. Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019.\n\nIn 2013, he launched the WikiLeaks Party and unsuccessfully stood for the Australian Senate. Also while in the embassy he was accused of interfering with the US presidential election; specifically he was alleged to have conspired with Russian agents to elect Donald Trump.\n\nOn 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested. He was found guilty of breaching the United Kingdom Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. The U.S. government unsealed an indictment charging Assange with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion related to the leaks provided by Manning. In May 2019 and June 2020, the U.S. government unsealed new indictments against Assange, charging him with violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and alleging he had conspired with hackers. The key witness for the new indictment, whom the justice department had given immunity in return for giving evidence, stated in 2021 that he had fabricated his testimony. Critics have described these charges as an unprecedented challenge to press freedom with potential implications for investigative journalism worldwide. Assange was incarcerated in HM Prison Belmarsh in London from April 2019 to June 2024, as the U.S. government's extradition effort was contested in the UK courts.\n\nIn June 2024, Assange was released from a UK prison after pleading guilty to one count of espionage as part of a plea deal brokered by his lawyer Barry Pollack. The deal ended nearly 15 years of legal proceedings, including his time in the Ecuadorian embassy and subsequent imprisonment. Assange was sentenced to time served and returned to Australia, arriving on 26 June. The plea agreement did not resolve the constitutional question of whether charging a publisher under the Espionage Act violates the First Amendment, leaving the issue legally unsettled.",

        "agent_updated_section": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. ( ; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who has been the 46th and current president of the United States since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic Party nominated Biden for president. He selected Kamala Harris as his running mate, and they defeated Republican incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to serve with a female vice president.\n\nAs president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In his foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel\u2013Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism and sent military aid to Israel, as well as humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign and, after the Democratic primaries, became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Public concerns about Biden's age and health persisted throughout his term, with intensified scrutiny after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27. In private, White House staffers and Biden's family took measures to conceal and compensate for apparent declines in his acuity. On July 21, he withdrew his candidacy, becoming the first U.S. president to decline to seek reelection after securing enough delegates to win renomination. Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris won the nomination but lost the general election to Trump. In his farewell address from the Oval Office in January 2025, Biden warned of the emergence of an oligarchy of extreme wealth and power in America, expressing concern that it threatened democracy and urging the preservation of democratic ideals under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump.",

In a September 2022 interview with 60 Minutes, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese, which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan. The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed. In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.\n\nOn February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his planned visit to China as the incident further damaged U.S.-China relations. In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries imported from China. It also raised tariffs on imports of Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical materials.\n\nIn April 2024, Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would ban social networking services within 270 to 360 days if they are determined by the president and relevant provisions to be a \"foreign adversary controlled application\". The act explicitly applies to ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which are all based in China. It ceases to be applicable if the foreign adversary controlled application is divested and no longer considered to be controlled by a foreign adversary of the United States. Biden had signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act in December 2022, prohibiting the use of TikTok on devices owned by the federal government. In February 2025, Biden issued an executive order to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity defenses against escalating cyber threats from China, emphasizing proactive threat hunting, the integration of artificial intelligence, and continuity of cybersecurity measures during the presidential transition. The order specifically addresses cyber espionage campaigns attributed to China, such as Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, and includes pilot programs within the Energy and Defense Departments.",

        "agent_updated_section": "Biden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages, and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years. The inflation rate peaked at 9% in June 2022. The inflation rate reached 2.9% and core inflation rate reached 3.2% on an annual basis in December 2024, the last full month of Biden's term. Between December 2020 and December 2024, CPI rose 21.3% overall, with an annualized inflation rate of 5.3% throughout Biden's term in office. The inflation rate remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021, resulting in elevated interest rates to combat inflation.

Real GDP grew 5.9%, the fastest rate in 37 years. Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year. By the end of 2021, inflation rates measured by the consumer price index (CPI) reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1%, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.

After 5.9% growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in 2022 to 2.1%, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5% in December. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June before easing to 3.2% by October 2023. Stocks had had their worst year since 2008 before recovering. Widespread predictions of an imminent recession did not materialize in 2022 or 2023, and by late 2023 indicators showed sharply lower inflation with economic acceleration. GDP growth hit 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and the year ended with stocks near record highs, with robust holiday spending.\n\nBiden signed numerous major pieces of economic legislation in the 117th Congress, including the American Rescue Plan, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. He signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022. It provided billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China. In his third month in office, Biden also signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022. His administration rigorously enforced antitrust law.\n\nIn 2022, Biden blocked a national railroad strike planned by multiple labor unions. During the United Auto Workers strike, he expressed support for the workers in negotiations. Biden joined striking UAW workers' picket line in Michigan, becoming the first president to join a picket line. He refused to block a port strike from the International Longshoremen's Association in October 2024.\n\nOver the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion.

He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.\n\nAt the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff after the U.S. hit its debt limit, which raised the risk that the U.S. would default on its debt. Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which suspended the debt limit until January 2025.

After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1\u00a0trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband. Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021. However, a March 2025 analysis found that despite the administration's ambitious promises and major legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there was limited progress in enacting meaningful changes to the transportation system or reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with key initiatives such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program seeing minimal implementation and impact.\n\nThe other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5\u00a0trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change. Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2\u00a0trillion. After Manchin rejected the bill, it was comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Manchin and Senator Chuck Schumer. The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform. According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51\u201350 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Biden signed the bill on August 16.\n\nBefore and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort. Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024. Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions. In July 2023, when heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change. In April 2024, he unveiled a plan to protect and restore natural water sources (3.2 million hectares of wetlands and 161,000\u00a0km of waterways).\n\nBiden protected 674 million acres of land and ocean from natural resource exploitation, more than any other president. The vast majority of the conservation came from a ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean.",

The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.\n\nIn 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\nIn June 2024, Biden issued an executive action offering amnesty to unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens. The program included a pathway to U.S. residency and citizenship and was expected to initially affect about 500,000 people. It was later struck down due to a lack of legislation empowering the president to enact the program.\n\nIn January 2025, Biden declared the lapsed Equal Rights Amendment ratified as the \"28th Amendment\" to the constitution. The declaration has no formal effect and the National Archives has said it does not intend to certify the amendment as part of the constitution, citing \"established legal, judicial, and procedural decisions\".\n\nIn March 2025, Senators introduced the bipartisan Ensuring Pathways to Innovative Cures (EPIC) Act to address concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's drug pricing provisions, particularly the impact on small molecule medicines. The EPIC Act seeks to equalize Medicare negotiation timelines for small molecule drugs and biologics, with support from patient advocacy groups and industry coalitions who argue that the current law could discourage innovation and limit patient access to new treatments.",

Throughout 2024, crossings began to significantly decline from the December record, after Biden implemented restrictions on asylum claims from migrants who cross the border between ports of entry and urged Mexico to crack down on migrants. Deportations from October 2023 to September 2024 reached the highest level since 2014. In February 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported around 12,000 migrants, a higher number compared to approximately 11,000 deportations in February 2024 under the early Trump administration, with the increase largely due to higher border crossing attempts in 2024. Deportations of immigrants arrested by ICE after dispersing into the U.S. nearly doubled from about 2,100 in February 2024 to roughly 4,300 in February 2025, and about half of those deported in February 2025 did not have criminal convictions or pending charges. The Biden administration also faced challenges with detention capacity, as ICE held nearly 44,000 migrants in detention at the end of February 2025, 10% more than at the end of Biden's term. Biden used humanitarian parole to an unprecedented degree to mitigate illegal border crossings, allowing migrants to fly into the U.S. or schedule their entries through official entry points in the U.S.-Mexico border. Over a million migrants had been admitted to the U.S. under humanitarian parole as of January 2024.\n\nIn January 2024, Biden expressed support for a proposed bipartisan immigration deal led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and James Lankford. He had previously supported the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which he proposed on his first day in office. The proposed bipartisan bill would have allowed DHS to close the border when encounters reach a seven-day average of 5,000 or exceed 8,500 in a single day. In addition, the bill would have mandated the detention of migrants seeking asylum and undergoing asylum interviews, with those failing the process repatriated to their home countries. While not addressing the status of \"Dreamers\", it would have changed immigration law to allow the children of those with H-1B visas to get work authorizations and freeze their legal ages while waiting for green cards, rather than face deportation once they turn 21, and provide additional funding for immigration judges.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump announced his opposition to the legislation, calling on Congressional Republicans to oppose it; subsequently, leaders such as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson announced their opposition, halting further legislative action.

        "agent_updated_section": "Ending months of speculation, on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for reelection as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. On the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was 37 percent, with most of those surveyed saying the economy was their biggest concern. During his campaign, Biden promoted higher economic growth and recovery. He frequently stated his intention to \"finish the job\" as a political rallying cry.\n\nU.S. Representative Dean Phillips ran against Biden in the 2024 Democratic presidential primaries, campaigning as a younger alternative who would be a stronger opponent to Trump. Biden was not on the ballot in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, but won it in a write-in campaign with 63.8% of the vote. He had wanted South Carolina to be the first primary, and won that state on February 3 with 96.2% of the vote. Biden received 89.3% of the vote in Nevada and 81.1% of the vote in Michigan. On March 5 (\"Super Tuesday\"), he won 15 of 16 primaries, netting 80% or more of the vote in 13. Biden lost the American Samoa contest to venture capitalist Jason Palmer, becoming the first incumbent president to lose a contest while appearing on the ballot since Jimmy Carter in 1980. On March 6, Phillips suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden. On March 12, Biden reached more than the 1,968 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, becoming the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe first presidential debate was held on June 27, 2024, between Biden and Trump. Biden's performance was widely criticized, with commentators saying he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering answers.

Since taking office in December 2023, President Javier Milei has implemented drastic economic measures, including cutting government spending by around 30% in real terms, laying off over 30,000 government workers, slashing energy and transport subsidies, suspending public-works projects, and freezing state wages and pensions. These austerity measures have contributed to a sharp decline in the monthly inflation rate, with Argentina's statistics authority INDEC reporting a drop to 2.7% in December 2024, down from 25.5% a year earlier.

Decreases in the prices of some key figures in the consumer price index such as electricity and rent have contributed as well.  Rent, for example, has \"dropped by 40 percent in real terms, and the supply of rental properties in Buenos Aires has increased by over 300 percent...\" as a result of Milei abolishing all forms of rent control.\n\nIn October 2024, Milei announced the shutting down of 'Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos' (AFIP), the Argentine tax agency. According to Bloomberg L\u00ednea, 80 percent of AFIP's 2024 budget was allocated for salary payments. With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were \"irregularly hired\" by the previous administration.

The move aligned the official and parallel exchange rates more closely. The official exchange rate is a government-set rate used in formal transactions and statistical calculations, such as trade and economic indicators. In contrast, the parallel exchange rate reflects market-driven values influenced by supply and demand and may differ due to factors like government controls or economic conditions.

In addition to a lack of support in Congress, observers pointed to a 200% inflation rate, rising poverty, and a polarized population as challenges for his presidency. His foreign minister, Diana Mondino, announced that Argentina would not join the BRICS bloc of developing economies as planned in 2024. In his first speech as president, Milei warned of an economic shock, described as shock therapy in monetary terms, to be used to fix Argentina's financial woes. Following his inauguration, Milei saw his popularity rise. After the first governmental and economic reforms he and his ministers made, 53% of the Argentine people had a good or excellent opinion of him, according to a poll by Aresco on 15 December.\n\nMilei's cabinet includes ministers from La Libertad Avanza and Juntos por el Cambio. In his first acts as president, Milei signed 13 decrees related to his cabinet members. He also lowered the number of ministries from 18 to 9. He appointed three secretariats with portfolio rank, including his sister, to the position of general secretary of the presidency after modifying the anti-nepotism law prohibiting the appointment of family members.\n\nMilei signed Decree 70/2023, deregulating the Argentine economy. It is subject to approval by Congress, which called for an extraordinary session to be held in the first months of 2024. As part of the measure, an estimated 5,000 public sector employees will be affected. An Argentine court halted the labor reforms that were part of the decree. The CGT also organized a general strike against the proposed policies involving tens of thousands of Argentine workers on a 12-hour strike, which resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights.\n\nIn a major foreign policy reversal, the Milei administration shelved plans to join BRICS, in which Argentina was slated to participate starting on 1 January 2024. In March 2024, Argentina announced a charge against Venezuela before the International Civil Aviation Organization for allegedly violating the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro banned Argentine aircraft from its airspace earlier amid traded accusations with Milei. In the same month, Milei approved the transfer of two military Mi-171E helicopters to Ukraine, which it later received. On 18 April, Argentina formally submitted its request to NATO to become a global partner. Meanwhile, various anti-government protests took place from January to June over e.g. not increasing university funds and cuts to subsidies and social programmes. These protests occurred in the context of broad, general approval according to a poll published by Clar\u00edn on 7 June 2024, where most Argentines had a positive image of their president and an optimistic view of future economic measures. Under his watch, Argentina exited deficit for the first time in 123 years.\n\nSince taking office, Milei has implemented several controversial policies affecting LGBTQ+ rights. He eliminated the Women, Gender and Diversity Ministry, closed the National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI), and dismissed trans employees hired under the Trans Labor Quota Law. On 5 February 2025, Milei issued a decree restricting minors' access to gender-affirming surgeries and hormone treatments. These actions led to widespread criticism and protests, including a criminal complaint after Milei linked the LGBTQ community to pedophilia during a speech at the World Economic Forum in January 2025. Activists have reported increased violence and discrimination against transgender and travesti communities, attributing this to Milei's rhetoric and policies.",

Argentina's monthly inflation slowed to 13.2% in February, compared to 20.6% in January and 25.5% in December. It reached a 3-year low of 2.7% in October 2024, with projections of further decreases. Starting in 2011, the country consistently ran a budget deficit, averaging 4.03% of GDP. Milei achieved a budget surplus within the first few months in office by gutting chunks of the government structure and downsizing it drastically.https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-posts-six-months-fiscal-financial-surpluses-2024-07-16/ This led to 20% of federal employees being laid off, saving the government nearly 20 billion dollars in expenses.\n\nThis decrease in the rate of inflation was driven primarily by the Government's elimination of deficit spending, leading to a decrease in monetary expansion.  Decreases in the prices of some key items in the consumer price index such as electricity and rent have contributed as well.  Rent, for example, has \"dropped by 40 percent in real terms, and the supply of rental properties in Buenos Aires has increased by over 300 percent...\" as a result of Milei abolishing all forms of rent control.\n\nIn October 2024, Milei announced the shutting down of 'Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos' (AFIP), the Argentine tax agency. According to Bloomberg L\u00ednea, 80 percent of AFIP's 2024 budget was allocated for salary payments. With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were \"irregularly hired\" by the previous administration. The changes will also slash \"higher-level positions by 45 percent and lower-level positions by 30 percent,\" reducing senior officials' salaries. Overall, the measures are expected to \"result in budgetary savings of around [6.4 million dollars] per year,\" the statement added. Reason magazine says, \"It will be replaced by a newly formed agency, the Agencia de Recaudaci\u00f3n y Control Aduanero (ARCA), which will assume some of its functions\". Meanwhile, Argentina's dollar-denominated international bonds reached new highs in March, with the 2029 and 2030 issues close to or at record-high prices. The bonds have rallied from lows that took the 2030 issue to 18.125 cents in July 2022, fueled by investor bets that the cabinet of Milei will be able to transform the Argentine economy successfully.\n\nAccording to a February 2024 study by the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, the poverty rate in January 2024 climbed to 57%, partly attributed to Milei's relaxing of controls on the exchange rate of Argentina's currency as it decreased the reported purchasing power of Argentinians. The move aligned the official and parallel exchange rates more closely. The official exchange rate is a government-set rate used in formal transactions and statistical calculations, such as trade and economic indicators. In contrast, the parallel exchange rate reflects market-driven values influenced by supply and demand and may differ due to factors like government controls or economic conditions. In March 2023, the parallel exchange rate of the peso was worth less than half of the official rate.\n\nIn July 2024, Milei set up the Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation to assist the government in matters related to deregulation, reform, and modernization of the Argentine state. It is headed by Federico Sturzenegger.Ignacio Olivera Doll: Federico Sturzenegger, architect of Argentina\u2019s reforms, says he isn\u2019t even halfway done. Buenos Aires Times, 2023-12-23. Retrieved 2024-01-06.\n\nThe opposition has criticised Milei's policies aimed at reversing hyperinflation for leading to an increase in poverty. During the first six months of his presidency, poverty rates increased by over 11%, from 41.7% to 52.9%, briefly peaking at 57.4% in the end of January 2024. In response, his government pointed out that poverty rates were already rising under previous administrations. According to a government report, poverty rates were projected at 38.9% during the third quarter of 2024. Furthermore, homelessness also seems to be declining, from being registered at 20.2% in the first quarter, 16% in the second, and projected at 8.6% in the third. This figure has been calculated by the Argentine government agency, the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC). The IMF has significant influence within INDEC in order to avoid the fabrication of misleading statistics.https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-27/i-love-you-i-hate-you-argentinas-toxic-relationship-with-the-imf.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170224053911/https://panampost.com/raquel-garcia/2016/11/10/imf-deems-argentinas-statistics-credible-again/ Conversely, the poverty rate in the third quarter is estimated at 49.9% by the Catholic University of Argentina, and 36.8% by the Torcuato Di Tella University.https://lapatria.bo/2024/12/31/la-pobreza-en-argentina-cae-al-368-en-el-segundo-semestre-de-2024/\n\nIn June, during a meeting in Berlin, Milei and German chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed support for a free trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur. An agreement on the free trade deal was announced on 6 December 2024. \n\nUnder his leadership Argentina has successfully paid back $4.3 billion debts to bondholders.\n\nIn the first and second quarter of 2024, Argentina's GDP contracted by 2.1% and 1.8%. However, in the last quarter, it expanded 3.9% despite the significant austerity Implemented by the president. Conversely, agriculture rebounded dramatically from a severe drought, achieving an impressive growth rate of 80.2% as conditions improved. The economy of Argentina is projected to grow by 5.5% in 2025 by the BBVA, and 3.5% by Goldman Sach's as inflation stabilizes and investment starts pouring in due to the Milei's liberalisation of the economy. The financial improvements seen in the 3rd quarter of 2024 are complemented by society\u2019s renewed confidence in the government, creating a positive outlook for 2025.  \n\nIn early 2025, Milei's administration enacted a second phase of economic reforms following initial stabilization efforts that ended Argentina's recession in late 2024. Key measures included reducing export taxes on agricultural products such as soybeans, soybean meal, corn, and wheat, reversing earlier increases to support producers amid low commodity prices and dry conditions. The government also focused on enhancing competitiveness in the food manufacturing sector and expanding agricultural export offices in Southeast Asia, signaling a strategic shift towards value-added production and international market engagement. These reforms contributed to an extended IMF loan program review and recognition from the IMF managing director of Argentina's economic improvements. Inflation rates dropped significantly from 220% in 2024 to 2.7% by October 2024, and GDP growth is projected at 5% for 2025, marking a recovery from a decade-long contraction.\n\nMoody's have increased Argentina's rating from 'Ca' to 'Caa3' due to the reforms initiated by President Millei.",

The move aligned the official and parallel exchange rates more closely. The official exchange rate is a government-set rate used in formal transactions and statistical calculations, such as trade and economic indicators.

During the first six months of his presidency, poverty rates increased by over 11%, from 41.7% to 52.9%, briefly peaking at 57.4% in the end of January 2024. In response, his government pointed out that poverty rates were already rising under previous administrations. According to a government report, poverty rates were projected at 38.9% during the third quarter of 2024. Furthermore, homelessness also seems to be declining, from being registered at 20.2% in the first quarter, 16% in the second, and projected at 8.6% in the third.

Argentina's monthly inflation slowed to 13.2% in February, compared to 20.6% in January and 25.5% in December. It reached a 3-year low of 2.7% in October 2024, with projections of further decreases. Starting in 2011, the country consistently ran a budget deficit, averaging 4.03% of GDP. Milei achieved a budget surplus within the first few months in office by gutting chunks of the government structure and downsizing it drastically.https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-posts-six-months-fiscal-financial-surpluses-2024-07-16/ This led to 20% of federal employees being laid off, saving the government nearly 20 billion dollars in expenses.\n\nThis decrease in the rate of inflation was driven primarily by the Government's elimination of deficit spending, leading to a decrease in monetary expansion.  Decreases in the prices of some key items in the consumer price index such as electricity and rent have contributed as well.  Rent, for example, has \"dropped by 40 percent in real terms, and the supply of rental properties in Buenos Aires has increased by over 300 percent...\" as a result of Milei abolishing all forms of rent control.\n\nIn October 2024, Milei announced the shutting down of 'Administraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos' (AFIP), the Argentine tax agency. According to Bloomberg L\u00ednea, 80 percent of AFIP's 2024 budget was allocated for salary payments. With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were \"irregularly hired\" by the previous administration. The changes will also slash \"higher-level positions by 45 percent and lower-level positions by 30 percent,\" reducing senior officials' salaries.

His rise to prominence during the 2023 presidential campaign, fueled by his primary win, sparked widespread attention, as did his central bank abolition and dollarization proposals.\n\nMilei is known for his flamboyant personality, distinctive personal style, and strong media presence, which sometimes causes controversy, and his embrace of conspiracy theories, including the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory. He has also called the idea of climate change as an anthropogenic phenomenon \"a socialist lie\" and said that concerns about it are nothing more than \"deceptions promoted by the neo-Marxists\", as are those related to the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Echoing Donald Trump, he also claimed electoral fraud ahead of the 2023 presidential runoff. Like other right-wing populists, his rhetoric focuses on opposing what he calls \"the political caste\". Milei's party was criticized for including among his candidates alleged neo-Nazis and apologists for the National Reorganization Process. During his political career, Milei has also been involved in several investigations and has been accused of having a violent attitude toward journalists and critics, as well as of misogynistic behavior, including toward women in journalism.\n\nMilei is a cosplayer with a superhero persona called \"General AnCap\". He also champions free love. In addition to being nicknamed el Peluca (\"The Wig\") for his eccentric hair, which has been compared to that of Trump and fellow right-wing populists Boris Johnson and Geert Wilders, Milei is known as el Loco (\"The Madman\"). News outlets have called him a \"rock singer and tantric sex instructor\", a \"former tantric sex coach\", and a \"mixture of a messianic preacher and a rock star\", and have likened him to both Trump and Wolverine. His admirers also call him \"The Lion\" because of the lyrics of the song \"Panic Show\" by rock band La Renga, which he sings in his public acts, coupled with his looks (in particular, his long hair).

Milei's supporters often carry chainsaws at rallies, symbolizing \"his promise to cut down the size of the state\".

Argentina's monthly inflation slowed to 13.2% in February, compared to 20.6% in January and 25.5% in December. It reached a 3-year low of 2.7% in October 2024, with projections of further decreases. This decrease in the rate of inflation was driven primarily by the Government's elimination of deficit spending, leading to a decrease in monetary expansion. Decreases in the prices of some key items in the consumer price index such as electricity and rent have contributed as well. In February 2025, however, Argentina's inflation rate rose by 2.4% month-over-month, slightly above analysts' expectations, while the annual inflation rate slowed to 66.9%, indicating a modest easing in inflationary pressures during Milei's presidency.\n\nAccording to a February 2024 study by the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, the poverty rate in January 2024 climbed to 57%, partly attributed to Milei's relaxing of controls on the exchange rate of Argentina's currency as it decreased the reported purchasing power of Argentinians. The move aligned the official and parallel exchange rates more closely. The official exchange rate is a government-set rate used in formal transactions and statistical calculations, such as trade and economic indicators. In contrast, the parallel exchange rate reflects market-driven values influenced by supply and demand and may differ due to factors like government controls or economic conditions. In March 2023, the parallel exchange rate of the peso was worth less than half of the official rate.\n\nIn 2024, the Argentinian peso appreciated by 44.2% against the dollar, outperforming all other currencies. In contrast, the second best performing currency against the dollar is the lira, which gained 21.2%, less than half of the pesos increase. These actions aimed to stabilize an economy teetering on the brink of hyperinflation. The pesos strengthening doubled average wages in dollar terms, up to $990.\n\nIn 2024, wages in Argentina rose by 145.5%, outpacing the 117.8% inflation rate, according to INDEC. According to Nowcast, the year-over-year increase in total family income (ITF) reached 185.7%. However, wage growth varied by sector. Formal private sector salaries increased by 147.5%, slightly above inflation, while public sector wages rose by only 119.3%. The biggest jump was in the informal sector, where incomes surged 196.7%. Despite wage increases, real income recovery has been uneven. In October 2024, CEPA reported that private sector wages had nearly returned to November 2023 levels. However, public sector incomes remained 14.8% lower, and informal workers were still down 21.3%.\"Pobreza en Argentina baj\u00f3 al 33.5% en enero 2025, seg\u00fan UTDT\" from La Derecha Diario\"Labor Monitor\" from UFM\"Argentina's Salaries Outpace Inflation with 145.5% Growth in 2024\" from The Rio Times\n\nMilei's reforms led to a decline in manufacturing sector activity in 2024, with a 9.4% overall contraction in the sector.

        "added_sentences": "Argentina's annual inflation has fallen from 211% in December 2023 to 193% in October 2024.https://www.reuters.com/markets/argentinas-inflation-rate-cools-consumers-still-feel-squeezed-2024-11-12/ Monthly inflation slowed in February 2024 for a second consecutive month as Milei continued to push austerity and deregulation measures to revive the country's struggling economy. Argentina's monthly inflation slowed to 13.2% in February, compared to 20.6% in January and 25.5% in December. It reached a 3-year low of 2.7% in October 2024, with projections of further decreases. This decrease in the rate of inflation was driven primarily by the Government's elimination of deficit spending, leading to a decrease in monetary expansion. Decreases in the prices of some key items in the consumer price index such as electricity and rent have contributed as well.<ins> In February 2025, however, Argentina's inflation rate rose by 2.4% month-over-month, slightly above analysts' expectations, while the annual inflation rate slowed to 66.9%, indicating a modest easing in inflationary pressures during Milei's presidency.</ins>\n\nAccording to a February 2024 study by the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, the poverty rate in January 2024 climbed to 57%, partly attributed to Milei's relaxing of controls on the exchange rate of Argentina's currency as it decreased the reported purchasing power of Argentinians. The move aligned the official and parallel exchange rates more closely. The official exchange rate is a government-set rate used in formal transactions and statistical calculations, such as trade and economic indicators. In contrast, the parallel exchange rate reflects market-driven values influenced by supply and demand and may differ due to factors like government controls or economic conditions. In March 2023, the parallel exchange rate of the peso was worth less than half of the official rate.\n\nIn 2024, the Argentinian peso appreciated by 44.2% against the dollar, outperforming all other currencies. In contrast, the second best performing currency against the dollar is the lira, which gained 21.2%, less than half of the pesos increase. These actions aimed to stabilize an economy teetering on the brink of hyperinflation. The pesos strengthening doubled average wages in dollar terms, up to $990.\n\nIn 2024, wages in Argentina rose by 145.5%, outpacing the 117.8% inflation rate, according to INDEC. According to Nowcast, the year-over-year increase in total family income (ITF) reached 185.7%. However, wage growth varied by sector. Formal private sector salaries increased by 147.5%, slightly above inflation, while public sector wages rose by only 119.3%. The biggest jump was in the informal sector, where incomes surged 196.7%.

His foreign minister, Diana Mondino, announced that Argentina would not join the BRICS bloc of developing economies, as had been planned for 2024. In his first speech as president, Milei warned of an economic shock, described as shock therapy in monetary terms, to be used to fix Argentina's financial woes.

In his first acts as president, Milei signed 13 decrees related to his cabinet members. He also lowered the number of ministries from 18 to 9. He appointed three secretariats with portfolio rank, including his sister, to the position of General Secretary of the Presidency, after modifying the anti-nepotism law prohibiting the appointment of family members.\n\nMilei signed Decree 70/2023, deregulating the Argentine economy. Since such a move is subject to approval by Congress, it called for an extraordinary session, to be held in the first months of 2024. As part of the measure, an estimated 5,000 public sector employees will be affected. An Argentine court halted the labor reforms that were part of the decree. The CGT also organized a general strike against the proposed policies involving tens of thousands of Argentine workers on a 12-hour strike, which resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights.\n\nIn March 2024, Argentina announced a charge against Venezuela before the International Civil Aviation Organization for allegedly violating the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro banned Argentine aircraft from its airspace earlier amid traded accusations with Milei. In the same month, Milei approved the transfer of two military Mi-171E helicopters to Ukraine, which it later received. On 18 April, Argentina formally submitted its request to NATO to become a global partner. Meanwhile, various anti-government protests took place from January to June over e.g. not increasing university funds and cuts to subsidies and social programmes. These protests occurred in the context of broad, general approval according to a poll published by Clar\u00edn on 7 June 2024, where most Argentines had a positive image of their president and an optimistic view of future economic measures. Under his watch, Argentina exited deficit for the first time in 123 years. In a speech given to the World Economic Forum, Milei encouraged a worldwide push for libertarianism, citing Argentina's economic success.\n\nIn March 2025, a large protest by pensioners in Buenos Aires demanding better pensions and free medicines escalated into violence between some protesters and security forces. Security forces used tear gas and water cannons, resulting in injuries, including a journalist severely injured by a tear gas canister.

According to Bloomberg L\u00ednea, 80 percent of AFIP's 2024 budget was allocated for salary payments. With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were \"irregularly hired\" by the previous administration. The changes will also slash \"higher-level positions by 45 percent and lower-level positions by 30 percent,\" reducing senior officials' salaries. Overall, the measures are expected to \"result in budgetary savings of around [6.4 million dollars] per year,\" the statement added. Reason magazine says, \"It will be replaced by a newly formed agency, the Agencia de Recaudaci\u00f3n y Control Aduanero (ARCA), which will assume some of its functions\". Meanwhile, Argentina's dollar-denominated international bonds reached new highs in March, with the 2029 and 2030 issues close to or at record-high prices. The bonds have rallied from lows that took the 2030 issue to 18.125 cents in July 2022, fueled by investor bets that the cabinet of Milei will be able to transform the Argentine economy successfully. Starting in 2011, the country consistently ran a budget deficit, averaging 4.03% of GDP. Milei achieved a budget surplus within the first few months in office by gutting chunks of the government structure and downsizing it drastically. This led to 20% of federal employees being laid off, saving the government nearly 20 billion dollars in expenses.\n\nRent has \"dropped by 40 percent in real term, and the supply of rental properties in Buenos Aires has increased by over 300 percent...\" as a result of Milei abolishing all forms of rent control.\n\nIn July 2024, Milei set up the Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation, to assist the government in matters related to deregulation, reform, and modernization of the Argentine state. It is headed by Federico Sturzenegger.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta shale formation is driving a major energy boom, making the country a net energy exporter for the first time in 14 years. With the world\u2019s fourth-largest shale oil reserves and second largest shale gas deposits, Argentina is set to overtake Colombia as South America\u2019s third-largest crude producer in 2025. Estimates suggest that Argentina's production in 2030 will scale to 1 million barrels per day, as Milei increases efforts in the extraction of oil and gas and reduces existing capital controls, export taxes and regulations. In April 2025, Milei announced the lifting of most of Argentina's strict capital and currency controls as part of agreements securing a $42 billion medium-term funding package from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. The IMF program targets a zero-deficit budget, and the central bank introduced a currency band for the peso, allowing it to float between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per US dollar, expanding monthly by 1%.

During his political career, Milei has also been involved in several investigations and has been accused of having a violent attitude toward journalists and critics, as well as of misogynistic behavior, including toward women in journalism. In April 2025, following the death of Pope Francis, Milei publicly expressed condolences and praised the pope's goodness and wisdom, marking a notable softening from his earlier harsh criticism during the 2023 campaign.

He has also called the idea of climate change as an anthropogenic phenomenon \"a socialist lie\" and said that concerns about it are nothing more than \"deceptions promoted by the neo-Marxists\", as are those related to the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Echoing Donald Trump, he also claimed electoral fraud ahead of the 2023 presidential runoff. Like other right-wing populists, his rhetoric focuses on opposing what he calls \"the political caste\". Milei's party was criticized for including among his candidates apologists for the National Reorganization Process. During his political career, Milei has also been involved in several investigations and has been accused of having a violent attitude toward journalists and critics, as well as of misogynistic behavior, including toward women in journalism.<ins> In April 2025, following the death of Pope Francis, Milei publicly expressed condolences and praised the pope's goodness and wisdom, marking a notable softening from his earlier harsh criticism during the 2023 campaign. His visit to the Vatican as president further reflected this shift toward a more conciliatory public image.</ins>\n\nMilei is a cosplayer with a superhero persona called \"General AnCap\". He also champions free love. In addition to being nicknamed el Peluca (\"The Wig\") for his eccentric hair, which has been compared to that of Trump and fellow right-wing populists Boris Johnson and Geert Wilders, Milei is known as el Loco (\"The Madman\"). News outlets have called him a \"rock singer and tantric sex instructor\", a \"former tantric sex coach\", and a \"mixture of a messianic preacher and a rock star\", and have likened him to both Trump and Wolverine. His admirers also call him \"The Lion\" because of the lyrics of the song \"Panic Show\" by rock band La Renga, which he sings in his public acts, coupled with his looks (in particular, his long hair). In 2024, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world, stating that \"with Milei in office, there will be no going back for Argentina\".\n\nThe chainsaw has become an enduring and popular symbol associated with Milei (he has been called the \"chainsaw candidate\"), specifically symbolizing his \"cutting\" of regulations, bureaucracy, and red tape in Argentina. Some commentators have called Milei's economic policy of cutting regulations \"chainsaw economics\". Milei's supporters often carry chainsaws at rallies, symbolizing \"his promise to cut down the size of the state\". Milei is also well known for his phrase \"\u00a1Viva la libertad, carajo!\", which is uttered most especially at the end of various speeches given by him.",

With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were \"irregularly hired\" by the previous administration. The changes will also slash \"higher-level positions by 45 percent and lower-level positions by 30 percent,\" reducing senior officials' salaries.

Meanwhile, Argentina's dollar-denominated international bonds reached new highs in March, with the 2029 and 2030 issues close to or at record-high prices. The bonds have rallied from lows that took the 2030 issue to 18.125 cents in July 2022, fueled by investor bets that the cabinet of Milei will be able to transform the Argentine economy successfully. Starting in 2011, the country consistently ran a budget deficit, averaging 4.03% of GDP. Milei achieved a budget surplus within the first few months in office by gutting chunks of the government structure and downsizing it drastically and reducing the salaries of high ranking authorities, leading to a reduction of government spending by 30%. This led to 20% of federal employees being laid off, saving the government nearly 20 billion dollars in expenses. The ministry of infrastructure, secretariat of science & technology, and the secretariat of education in particular saw most or almost all of their funding disappear, along with major cuts to the pension fund, where the Argentinian pensioner of the lowest income bracket only receives 320 dollars a month, slightly more than a third of what the average household needs to survive. The funding for the office of the Presidency was also cut by 13.3%, whilst the Argentinian intelligence agency saw a 215.9% increase in their budget. Although the reforms have led towards a crisis being averted, for the first semester the people still had to endure the pain that comes with shock therapy treatment, namely the rising healthcare costs and the reduction of funding for several social programs. Consumption has markedly decreased under Milei since the start of his presidency, showing a 10.2% year-over-year drop in February 2025, compared to February 2024. The strongest decline was seen in September 2024, where consumption had decreased 22.3% compared to the year before it, in line with the estimates concerning austerity. At the end of the year, real wage growth had outpaced inflation for the first time in 4 years.\n\nIn April 2025, Milei dismantled long-standing currency controls, partially floated the peso, and eased restrictions on dollar purchases after securing a $20 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. The peso fell by 6% in the first week, and inflation is expected to rise slightly, but the move was intended to relieve pressure on the central bank and was supported by additional backing from China and the U.S. Treasury.\n\nRent has \"dropped by 40 percent in real term, and the supply of rental properties in Buenos Aires has increased by over 300 percent...\" as a result of Milei abolishing all forms of rent control.\n\nIn July 2024, Milei set up the Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation, to assist the government in matters related to deregulation, reform, and modernization of the Argentine state.

Nearly 30,000 undocumented migrants crossed the Channel in small boats to the UK in 2023. Long-term net migration to the United Kingdom (the number of people immigrating minus the number emigrating) reached a record high of 764,000 in 2022, with legal immigration at 1.26 million and emigration at 493,000. Of the 1,218,000 legal migrants coming to the UK in 2023, only 10% were EU Nationals.\n\nSunak continued the Rwanda asylum plan to have asylum seekers and illegal immigrants sent to Rwanda for processing.

Following his defeat to Keir Starmer's Labour Party in the 2024 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition, serving in this role from July to November 2024. He previously held two Cabinet positions under Boris Johnson, latterly as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2020 to 2022. Sunak has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond and Northallerton, previously Richmond (Yorks), since 2015.\n\nSunak was born in Southampton to parents of Indian descent who immigrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He was educated at Winchester College, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Lincoln College, Oxford, and earned a Master of Business Administration from Stanford University in California as a Fulbright Scholar. During his time at Oxford University, Sunak joined the Conservatives. After graduating, Sunak worked for Goldman Sachs and later as a partner at two hedge fund firms. Sunak was elected to the House of Commons at the 2015 general election. As a backbencher, Sunak supported the successful campaign for Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum. Sunak was appointed to the junior ministerial position of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Local Government by Theresa May in 2019, and was appointed to the cabinet-attending role of Chief Secretary to the Treasury by Johnson in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, Sunak was promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer. During his time in the position, Sunak was prominent in the government's financial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, including the furlough and Eat Out to Help Out schemes, and the cost-of living crisis. As chancellor, Sunak received high approval and popularity ratings in the early stages of the pandemic, although his popularity later declined amid the cost-of living crisis in 2022. He resigned as chancellor in July 2022 amid a government crisis, and lost the subsequent leadership election to Liz Truss. After spending the duration of Truss's premiership on the backbenches, Sunak was elected unopposed in the leadership election to succeed Truss; aged 42 at the time he became prime minister, Sunak became the youngest prime minister since The Earl of Liverpool in 1812.\n\nDuring his premiership, Sunak attempted to improve the economy and stabilise national politics. He outlined five key priorities: halving inflation, growing the economy, cutting debt, reducing National Health Service waiting lists, and stopping the illegal small-boat crossings of the English Channel by enacting the Rwanda asylum plan. On foreign policy, Sunak authorised foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion of the country, and pledged support for Israel after the attacks which began the Israel\u2013Hamas war whilst later calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. He did not avert further unpopularity for the Conservatives, reflected in the party's poor performances in the 2023 and 2024 local elections. Sunak called a general election for July 2024 despite being widely expected to call the election in the autumn; the Conservatives lost this election in a landslide to the opposition Labour Party led by Keir Starmer, ending 14 years of Conservative government.\n\nAfter leaving office, Sunak became Leader of the Opposition and remained Conservative leader for nearly four months while the leadership election to replace him took place, and formed a shadow cabinet. He was succeeded by Kemi Badenoch, his Shadow Housing Secretary. In April 2025, as part of his resignation honours, Sunak awarded a peerage to Michael Gove, allowing Gove to sit for life in the House of Lords. He also intends to remain as a backbench MP for the next five years.",

At the age of 18 he immigrated to Canada, acquiring its citizenship through his Canadian-born mother, Maye. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.

In 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial intelligence company.\n\nMusk's actions and expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic comments, and promoting conspiracy theories.

        "agent_updated_section": "In 2018, Musk was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies. Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20\u00a0million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.\n\nIn 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half\u00a0a\u00a0million cars that year.

Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets. With $100\u00a0million of his early fortune, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.\n\nSpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006. Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, then led by Mike Griffin. After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6\u00a0billion NASA contract for Falcon 9-launched Dragon spacecraft flights to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.\n\nWorking towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform. Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload. Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing Starship, a reusable, super heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan. In April 2025, voting began on the incorporation of Starbase, a proposed city primarily populated by SpaceX employees and their relatives, with official declaration expected in May 2025 pending the outcome of the vote.",

Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman had previously stated that he had hacked Harry's phone on nine occasions. He sought damages in excess of \u00a3200,000 from the publisher of the News of the World and The Sun and alleged an earlier agreement between News Group Newspapers and the royal family which would see he and William not take legal action in return for an apology had not been honoured. A palace source denied the existence of any secret agreements. Both brothers brought a claim privately through their mutual attorneys, but Harry decided to pursue his case separately with a new solicitor in 2019. In April 2023, a High Court judge said there were inconsistencies in Harry's claim, including the time when he became aware of the issue's full scale and his failure to mention an alleged agreement between the publisher and the palace. In July 2023, the judge ruled that part of Harry's case involving allegations of illegal information gathering would go to trial but his phone-hacking claims were dismissed for being made too late. In May 2024, Mr Justice Fancourt refused Harry the permission to include claims against Rupert Murdoch, expand his case's scope back to 1994 and 1995 to cover allegations involving his mother or to add new allegations from 2016 involving his then-girlfriend Meghan. In the following month, Mr Justice Fancourt ordered Harry to provide a written statement explaining why messages sent to his memoir ghostwriter that could potentially be related to his hacking claims had been deleted. Additionally, he decided that a search of Harry's laptop, text messages, and WhatsApp conversations was necessary in order to examine conversations that took place between 2005 and the beginning of 2023. In October 2024, the judge announced that the two sides should either settle or go to trial in January 2025 and refused to let Harry's team include allegations that bugs were placed in rooms and cars, and trackers placed on vehicles as \"no particulars whatsoever of such allegations\" were provided. The trial against News Group Newspapers is scheduled to begin in June 2024. During his UK visit for the trial, Harry will receive limited armed police protection from the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, following an agreement with Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley. He was offered accommodation at Buckingham Palace but declined, and is staying elsewhere.\n\nLawyers for the Mirror denied accessing Harry's voicemail messages and other allegations, but admitted to instructing \"private investigators to unlawfully obtain private information\" about Harry on a single occasion that involved him visiting Chinawhite. In January 2023, a High Court judge ruled that Harry's lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) as well as other similar lawsuits against the publisher would go to trial in May 2023. At the beginning of trial, MGN apologised for one instance of unlawful information gathering against Harry and added that his legal challenge \"warrants compensation\". In June 2023, Harry testified in the court case accusing former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan of horrific personal attacks and claimed that his phone had been hacked dating back to when he was still at Eton. His appearance marked the first time a member of the royal family had been cross-examined in court since Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, appeared as a witness in court in 1891. In December 2023, the High Court ruled in favour of Harry for 15 of the 33 sample stories used in his claims of phone hacking against MGN and awarded him \u00a3140,600 of the \u00a3440,000 he sought in damages. Mr Justice Fancourt concluded Piers Morgan and other editors knew about the phone hacking at their publications and were involved in it. Harry through his lawyer David Sherborne called the ruling \"vindicating and affirming\" and urged the authorities to further investigate and prosecute the company. An additional 115 articles from Harry's claim might have been the focus of two further trials, but in February 2024 he settled his claim with MGN. The publisher agreed to cover Harry's legal costs and pay damages reported to be in the region of \u00a3300,000.

In May 2024, Mr Justice Fancourt refused Harry the permission to include claims against Rupert Murdoch, expand his case's scope back to 1994 and 1995 to cover allegations involving his mother or to add new allegations from 2016 involving his then-girlfriend Meghan. In the following month, Mr Justice Fancourt ordered Harry to provide a written statement explaining why messages sent to his memoir ghostwriter that could potentially be related to his hacking claims had been deleted. Additionally, he decided that a search of Harry's laptop, text messages, and WhatsApp conversations was necessary in order to examine conversations that took place between 2005 and the beginning of 2023. In October 2024, the judge announced that the two sides should either settle or go to trial in January 2025 and refused to let Harry's team include allegations that bugs were placed in rooms and cars, and trackers placed on vehicles as \"no particulars whatsoever of such allegations\" were provided. In January 2025, just before the trial was set to begin, News Group Newspapers issued a full and unequivocal apology to Harry for serious intrusions into his private life by The Sun between 1996 and 2011, including phone hacking and surveillance, and agreed to pay substantial damages. The apology also acknowledged distress caused to Harry's family, including his late mother, Princess Diana, and marked the first time the company admitted wrongdoing at The Sun.\n\nLawyers for the Mirror denied accessing Harry's voicemail messages and other allegations, but admitted to instructing \"private investigators to unlawfully obtain private information\" about Harry on a single occasion that involved him visiting Chinawhite. In January 2023, a High Court judge ruled that Harry's lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) as well as other similar lawsuits against the publisher would go to trial in May 2023. At the beginning of trial, MGN apologised for one instance of unlawful information gathering against Harry and added that his legal challenge \"warrants compensation\". In June 2023, Harry testified in the court case accusing former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan of horrific personal attacks and claimed that his phone had been hacked dating back to when he was still at Eton. His appearance marked the first time a member of the royal family had been cross-examined in court since Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, appeared as a witness in court in 1891. In December 2023, the High Court ruled in favour of Harry for 15 of the 33 sample stories used in his claims of phone hacking against MGN and awarded him \u00a3140,600 of the \u00a3440,000 he sought in damages. Mr Justice Fancourt concluded Piers Morgan and other editors knew about the phone hacking at their publications and were involved in it. Harry through his lawyer David Sherborne called the ruling \"vindicating and affirming\" and urged the authorities to further investigate and prosecute the company. An additional 115 articles from Harry's claim might have been the focus of two further trials, but in February 2024 he settled his claim with MGN. The publisher agreed to cover Harry's legal costs and pay damages reported to be in the region of \u00a3300,000.",

The IPSO rejected Harry's claim that the paper's description was \"inaccurate\" or \"misleading\".\n\nIn December 2020, Harry's legal team sued Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) for publishing a story in the Mail on Sunday claiming his working relationship with the Royal Marines had suffered post-royal departure. The newspaper subsequently accepted the claims were false and issued an apology. The prince's lawyer said the \"substantial damages\" paid by the publisher would be donated to the Invictus Games Foundation.\n\nIn November 2021, Harry and Meghan's former communications secretary Jason Knauf gave a statement to the court following ANL's appeal against a judge's ruling that accused the media company of breaching Meghan's privacy for publishing a letter she had sent to her father. Knauf mentioned the Duchess of Sussex directly gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and added that the Duke of Sussex had welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement with the process of writing the book, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\". ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense, arguing that the Duke and Duchess had \"co-operated with the authors of the recently published book Finding Freedom to put out their version of certain events\".\n\nIn February 2022, Harry filed a libel suit in the High Court against ANL for a Mail on Sunday article which alleged he was trying to keep his legal battle against the Home Office to restore his police protection secret from the public through requesting a confidentiality order on the case and that he offered to pay for police protection only after filing a lawsuit against the government. In June 2022, Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that parts of the article were potentially defamatory, though Nicklin rejected claims by Harry's lawyers that the article portrayed him as a liar. Harry attempted to have the publisher's defence thrown out, but the judge rejected his motion in December 2023 and decided that the case should proceed to trial. He later ordered Harry to pay Mail on Sunday \u00a348,447 in legal costs. Harry withdrew the libel claim in January 2024 and became liable for the publisher's \u00a3250,000 legal costs. In December 2023, the High Court ruled that Harry was a victim of phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers, awarding him \u00a3140,600 in damages and condemning the publisher's conduct. Harry also settled out of court with News Group Newspapers, which issued a full apology and agreed to pay substantial damages for serious intrusions including phone hacking and misuse of private information.\n\nIn October 2022, the Duke of Sussex joined Doreen Lawrence, Sir Elton John, David Furnish, Sadie Frost, and Elizabeth Hurley in launching a legal action against ANL for their alleged \"abhorrent criminal activity\", which was said to involve listening to and recording people's phone calls and daily activities, obtaining sensitive information and medical records, and accessing bank accounts and financial transactions. In a statement, ANL described the allegations as \"preposterous smears\", and Gavin Burrows, the private investigator whose alleged 2021 statement was used as a key element in the case, said that the statement was not signed by him and was \"a cut and paste from my evidence\" of other publishers targeting individuals. In November 2023, Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that the case brought by Harry and the other claimants could proceed but unpublished material provided to the Leveson Inquiry was inadmissible as proof in this case. As of early 2025, Harry and other claimants, including Elton John, are pursuing a major lawsuit against Associated Newspapers for alleged unlawful information gathering from 1993 to 2011, with some acts alleged as late as 2018; the full trial is expected in early 2026.",

        "agent_updated_section": "In mid-2016, Harry began a relationship with American actress Meghan Markle. According to the couple, they first connected with each other via Instagram, though they have also said that they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend in July 2016. On 8 November, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls. In September 2017, Prince Harry and Markle first appeared together in public at the Invictus Games in Toronto. Their engagement was announced on 27 November 2017 by Harry's father. The announcement prompted generally positive comments about having a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family, especially in regard to Commonwealth countries with populations of blended or native ancestry. The marriage ceremony was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 19 May 2018. The couple later revealed in the 2021 television interview Oprah with Meghan and Harry that, three days prior to the ceremony, they had privately exchanged vows in their garden, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, this earlier exchange of vows was not an official religious or legally recognised marriage.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess initially lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace. In May 2018, it was reported that they had signed a two-year lease on WestfieldLarge, located on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds. They gave up the lease after photos of the house and its interior were published by a paparazzi agency. The couple considered settling at the 21-room Apartment 1 within Kensington Palace, but moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle which Queen Elizabeth II had recently gifted to them instead. The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of \u00a32.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time. On 6 May 2019, the Duke and Duchess's son, Archie, was born. Their office was moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on 31 March 2020 when the Sussexes ceased \"undertaking official engagements in support of the Queen\". After some months in Canada and the United States, the couple bought a house in June 2020 on the former estate of Riven Rock in Montecito, California. The next month, the Duchess suffered a miscarriage. On 4 June 2021, their daughter, Lilibet, was born. As of early March 2025, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle continue to reside in their Montecito home, where they are raising their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. During the Invictus Games 2025 in Canada, Harry spoke about the ease of raising their children in California, and Meghan introduced him at an event prior to the opening ceremony; their children did not accompany them to the event. The Duke and Duchess have owned a Labrador named Pula, and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia.\n\nIn 2017, Harry stated that he had \"five or six\" godchildren, some of whom later attended his wedding.",

In September 2017, Prince Harry and Markle first appeared together in public at the Invictus Games in Toronto. Their engagement was announced on 27 November 2017 by Harry's father. The announcement prompted generally positive comments about having a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family, especially in regard to Commonwealth countries with populations of blended or native ancestry. The marriage ceremony was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 19 May 2018. The couple later revealed in the 2021 television interview Oprah with Meghan and Harry that, three days prior to the ceremony, they had privately exchanged vows in their garden, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of \u00a32.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time.

Their office was moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on 31 March 2020 when the Sussexes ceased \"undertaking official engagements in support of the Queen\".

He exceeded Griezmann as France's third all-time top scorer, reaching 46 goals.\n\nIn France's opening match of Euro 2024, a 1\u20130 win against Austria, Mbapp\u00e9 helped create the only goal of the match \u2013 an own goal \u2013 when his cross was deflected by Maximilian W\u00f6ber into his own net; however, Mbapp\u00e9 later suffered a broken nose during the game, resulting in him being substituted, and sidelined for the following fixture against the Netherlands. In the final group match against Poland, he scored his first goal ever at the European Championships from a penalty in a 1\u20131 draw, which saw France advance to the knockout stages after finishing second in their group behind Austria with five points. In the semi-finals, he set-up Randal Kolo Muani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 defeat to Spain. Following the elimination from the tournament, in a post-match interview, Mbapp\u00e9 described his European Championship display as a 'failure'.<ins>\n\nMbapp\u00e9 returned to the France national team in March 2025 after a six-month absence and captained the side in the first leg of the Nations League quarterfinals against Croatia, where France lost 2\u20130. As of March 2025, he is 26 years old, remains captain, and is third on France's all-time scoring list with 48 goals, though he has scored only twice in his last 13 international appearances.</ins>",

She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year. The next year she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"Feminist\". Her self-identification incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyonc\u00e9's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'.\n\nAdichie responded with \"her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.\" Adichie expands upon what \"feminist lite\" means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to 'treat women well'\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 responded about her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it. She says to understand what being a feminist is, \"it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\" She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our societies and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.\n\nShe has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses TV and social media to encourage leadership in girls. Following Beyonc\u00e9's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.\n\nIn December 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 U.S. mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Beyonc\u00e9 publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8. She spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.\n\nShe has condemned police brutality against black Americans. She and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin. The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\". In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyonc\u00e9 responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".\n\nIn February 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration.

Aged five, Beyonc\u00e9 attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose. When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\" Beyonc\u00e9 was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, and once said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".\n\nShe admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\", and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did\". Beyonc\u00e9 cited Madonna as an influence \"not only for her musical style, but also for her business sense\", saying that she wanted to \"follow in the footsteps of Madonna and be a powerhouse and have my own empire\". She also credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child. Her other musical influences include Rachelle Ferrell, Aaliyah, Janet Jackson, Prince, Lauryn Hill, Sade Adu, Donna Summer, Fairuz, Mary J. Blige, Selena, Anita Baker, and Toni Braxton.\n\nThe feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyonc\u00e9's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls and by singer Josephine Baker. Beyonc\u00e9 paid homage to Baker by performing \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. Beyonc\u00e9's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyonc\u00e9 to explore other musical genres and styles. Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince. In 2025, collaborators such as Rhiannon Giddens reflected on Beyonc\u00e9's album 'Cowboy Carter,' noting that while it incorporated traditional Black musical elements like the banjo, some felt its cultural lineage was not fully honored and that the album blended pop, hip-hop, and R&B with country influences rather than revolutionizing country music or reclaiming the banjo's Black origins. Beyonc\u00e9 stated that the album was not intended as a country album, challenging public perceptions.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all\", and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman\". She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life. Beyonc\u00e9 has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music\u00a0... he is lyrical and raw\".

The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyonc\u00e9 an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.

Beyonc\u00e9's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011. In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released. The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line, with sales of over $400\u00a0million. In April 2025, Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother Tina Knowles promoted the launch of their haircare line, C\u00e9cred, at Ulta Beauty. The brand expanded from exclusive online availability to being sold in Ulta stores and online, featuring all 16 products from the Foundation Collection and receiving positive fan reviews.\n\nThe release of a video-game Starpower: Beyonc\u00e9 was cancelled after Beyonc\u00e9 pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.

Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.\n\nIn November 2020, Beyonc\u00e9 formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyonc\u00e9 and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs.

The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line, with sales of over $400\u00a0million. <ins>In April 2025, Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother Tina Knowles promoted the launch of their haircare line, C\u00e9cred, at Ulta Beauty. The brand expanded from exclusive online availability to being sold in Ulta stores and online, featuring all 16 products from the Foundation Collection and receiving positive fan reviews.</ins>\n\nThe release of a video-game Starpower: Beyonc\u00e9 was cancelled after Beyonc\u00e9 pulled out of a $100 million deal with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.  Beyonc\u00e9 also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L'Or\u00e9al since the age of 18.\n\nIn March 2015, Beyonc\u00e9 became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.\n\nIn November 2020, Beyonc\u00e9 formed a multi-year partnership with exercise equipment and media company Peloton. The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyonc\u00e9 and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyonc\u00e9 around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\" Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.\n\nIn 2021, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z partnered with Tiffany & Co. for the company's \"About Love\" campaign. Beyonc\u00e9 became the fourth woman, and first Black woman, to wear the 128.54-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond. The campaign featured a robin egg blue painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat titled Equals Pi (1982). Both Beyonce and the brand faced significant backlash for the campaign, as the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which was discovered in the Kimberley diamond mines in South Africa in 1877, is classified as a blood diamond and viewed as a symbol of British colonialism over Africa.",

She began executive producing the comedy series Dollface, which streamed on Hulu from 2019 to 2022. Robbie was filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's only choice to portray the late actress Sharon Tate in his period film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. With the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders serving as a backdrop, the film tells the story of a fading character actor (DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate New Hollywood in 1969 Los Angeles. Feeling \"an enormous sense of responsibility\", Robbie prepared for the role by meeting Tate's family members and friends, watching all of her films and reading the autobiography by Tate's then-husband, Roman Polanski. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim, and was a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $374.3 million. Despite many bemoaning Robbie's lack of lines in the film, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph highlighted a scene with Robbie in the cinema, which he found to be the film's \"most delightful\" scene.\n\nAlso in 2019, she starred as Kayla Pospisil, a composite character based on several Fox News employees, in Jay Roach's drama Bombshell. Co-starring Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman, the film recounts stories of various female personnel at the news network and their sexual harassment by the network's chairman Roger Ailes. Robbie based her character's accent on Katherine Harris. The film received positive reviews; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Robbie [is] at her best, the arc of her story is so crushing that it stays with you the longest.\" For her performances in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Bombshell, she received two nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and for the latter she received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award; all in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nRobbie began the new decade by reprising the role of Harley Quinn in Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey (2020). Determined to make a female ensemble action film, she pitched the idea for the film to Warner Bros. in 2015. Robbie spent the subsequent three years developing the project under her production company, making a concerted effort to hire a female director and screenwriter. Birds of Prey, along with Robbie's performance, gained generally positive reviews; Ian Freer of Empire wrote that \"the MVP is Robbie, who lends Harley charming quirk and believable menace, hinting at Harley's inner life without reams of dialogue.\" She received two nominations at the 46th People's Choice Awards.\n\nRobbie served as a producer on Promising Young Woman (2020), a comedy thriller by writer-director Emerald Fennell, starring Carey Mulligan as a woman who seeks to avenge the rape and death of her best friend. The film received acclaim, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2021, Robbie reprised her voice role as Flopsy Rabbit in Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway, which received mixed reviews and grossed $153.8 million worldwide. She also made her third outing as Quinn in the standalone sequel The Suicide Squad, written and directed by James Gunn. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was simultaneously released theatrically and on the streaming service HBO Max. Owen Gleiberman praised Robbie's \"delectable performance\" in it. She also served as an executive producer for the Netflix miniseries Maid.\n\nIn 2022, Robbie reprised her role as Donna Freedman for the final episode of Neighbours. She starred alongside an ensemble cast in David O. Russell's period comedy Amsterdam, based on the 1933 Business Plot. The film emerged as a critical and commercial failure. In her second film release of the year, she played Nellie LaRoy, an actress inspired by silent movie star Clara Bow, in Damien Chazelle's comedy-drama Babylon. In preparation, she studied the works of Bow and researched her traumatic childhood. She described LaRoy as \"the most physically and emotionally draining character I've ever played\". The film polarised critics and had poor box office returns, though her performance received praise; Caryn James of BBC Culture opined, \"Robbie's bold, charismatic performance makes Nellie a daring, endlessly spiraling, sympathetic figure\". She received another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, although the underperformance of her two major releases that year led some commentators to brand her as \"box office poison\" at the time.\n\nIn the following year, Robbie had a single scene in Wes Anderson's ensemble comedy film Asteroid City. Chris Hewitt of the Star Tribune described her \"impassioned acting in her lone scene\" as \"perfectly judged\". The fantasy comedy Barbie, co-starring Ryan Gosling as Ken, was her next film release. As producer, Robbie bought the rights from Mattel for a film about the eponymous fashion doll in 2018. She hired Greta Gerwig to write and direct the film, and took on the title role herself after Gal Gadot declined her offer. In preparation, Gerwig and Robbie watched old Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964). Variety reported that Robbie earned $12.5 million for the role, the highest for an actress in Hollywood that year. Vulture Alison Willmore took note of how much Robbie fit the part, and commended her for combining both \"heartbreaking earnestness\" and \"humor\" in her performance. With a worldwide gross of over $1.4 billion, Barbie emerged as Robbie's highest-grossing release. She received further BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for her performance, in addition to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nAlso in 2023, Robbie produced Fennell's second directorial, Saltburn. The 2024 Sundance Film Festival marked the release of her next production, Megan Park's comedy film My Old Ass. Robbie will next star alongside Colin Farrell in Kogonada's film A Big Bold Beautiful Journey and Jacob Elordi in Fennell's Wuthering Heights, adapted from the novel.

She began executive producing the comedy series Dollface, which streamed on Hulu from 2019 to 2022. Robbie was filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's only choice to portray the late actress Sharon Tate in his period film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. With the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders serving as a backdrop, the film tells the story of a fading character actor (DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate New Hollywood in 1969 Los Angeles. Feeling \"an enormous sense of responsibility\", Robbie prepared for the role by meeting Tate's family members and friends, watching all of her films and reading the autobiography by Tate's then-husband, Roman Polanski. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim, and was a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $374.3 million. Despite many bemoaning Robbie's lack of lines in the film, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph highlighted a scene with Robbie in the cinema, which he found to be the film's \"most delightful\" scene.\n\nAlso in 2019, she starred as Kayla Pospisil, a composite character based on several Fox News employees, in Jay Roach's drama Bombshell. Co-starring Charlize Theron and Nicole Kidman, the film recounts stories of various female personnel at the news network and their sexual harassment by the network's chairman Roger Ailes. Robbie based her character's accent on Katherine Harris. The film received positive reviews; Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Robbie [is] at her best, the arc of her story is so crushing that it stays with you the longest.\" For her performances in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Bombshell, she received two nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and for the latter she received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award; all in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nRobbie began the new decade by reprising the role of Harley Quinn in Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey (2020). Determined to make a female ensemble action film, she pitched the idea for the film to Warner Bros. in 2015. Robbie spent the subsequent three years developing the project under her production company, making a concerted effort to hire a female director and screenwriter. Birds of Prey, along with Robbie's performance, gained generally positive reviews; Ian Freer of Empire wrote that \"the MVP is Robbie, who lends Harley charming quirk and believable menace, hinting at Harley's inner life without reams of dialogue.\" She received two nominations at the 46th People's Choice Awards.\n\nRobbie served as a producer on Promising Young Woman (2020), a comedy thriller by writer-director Emerald Fennell, starring Carey Mulligan as a woman who seeks to avenge the rape and death of her best friend. The film received acclaim, earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2021, Robbie reprised her voice role as Flopsy Rabbit in Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway, which received mixed reviews and grossed $153.8 million worldwide. She also made her third outing as Quinn in the standalone sequel The Suicide Squad, written and directed by James Gunn. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was simultaneously released theatrically and on the streaming service HBO Max. Owen Gleiberman praised Robbie's \"delectable performance\" in it. She also served as an executive producer for the Netflix miniseries Maid.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Robbie reprised her role as Donna Freedman for the final episode of Neighbours. She starred alongside an ensemble cast in David O. Russell's period comedy Amsterdam, based on the 1933 Business Plot. The film emerged as a critical and commercial failure. In her second film release of the year, she played Nellie LaRoy, an actress inspired by silent movie star Clara Bow, in Damien Chazelle's comedy-drama Babylon. In preparation, she studied the works of Bow and researched her traumatic childhood. She described LaRoy as \"the most physically and emotionally draining character I've ever played\". The film polarised critics and had poor box office returns, though her performance received praise; Caryn James of BBC Culture opined, \"Robbie's bold, charismatic performance makes Nellie a daring, endlessly spiraling, sympathetic figure\". She received another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, although the underperformance of her two major releases that year led some commentators to brand her as \"box office poison\" at the time.\n\nIn the following year, Robbie had a single scene in Wes Anderson's ensemble comedy film Asteroid City. Chris Hewitt of the Star Tribune described her \"impassioned acting in her lone scene\" as \"perfectly judged\". The fantasy comedy Barbie, co-starring Ryan Gosling as Ken, was her next film release. As producer, Robbie bought the rights from Mattel for a film about the eponymous fashion doll in 2018. She hired Greta Gerwig to write and direct the film, and took on the title role herself after Gal Gadot declined her offer. In preparation, Gerwig and Robbie watched old Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964).

        "agent_updated_section": "As of 2024, Huang has been Nvidia's chief executive for over three decades, a tenure described by The Wall Street Journal as \"almost unheard of in fast-moving Silicon Valley\". He owns 3.6% of Nvidia's stock, which went public in 1999. He earned as CEO in 2007, ranking him as the 61st highest paid U.S. CEO by Forbes. According to Huang, the three co-founders in 1993 had \"no idea how\" to start a company, \"building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder\" than they expected, and they probably would not have done it if they had realized up front \"the pain and suffering [involved] ... the challenges [they were] going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that [would] go wrong.\" For its first graphics accelerator chips, Nvidia focused on rendering quadrilateral primitives (forward texture mapping) instead of the triangle primitives preferred by its competitors, and barely survived long enough to successfully pivot to triangles only because Sega agreed to keep Nvidia alive with a $5 million investment. By the time the RIVA 128 was released in August 1997 and saved the company, Nvidia was down to one month of payroll. This resulted in the \"unofficial company motto\": \"Our company is thirty days from going out of business.\" Huang regularly began presentations to Nvidia staff with those words for many years. However, Huang regards the \"pain and suffering\" of Nvidia's early years as essential to the company's success in later years, because it forced him to become a better leader.\n\nHuang does not keep a fixed office; he roams Nvidia's headquarters and settles temporarily in conference rooms as needed. He prefers to maintain a relatively flat management structure, with around 60 direct reports as of November 2024, on the ground that people reporting directly to him \"should be at the top of their game\" and \"require the least amount of pampering\". He does not wear a watch, because as he likes to say, \"now is the most important time\".\n\nHistorically, Huang and Nvidia were well-known only among the gamers and computer graphics experts who were the original intended markets for Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) products. In 2017, a Fortune profile article acknowledged: \"If you haven\u2019t heard of Nvidia, you can be forgiven.\" During the AI boom, Huang's net worth rose rapidly along with the value of Nvidia's stock, from in 2019 to in May 2024. During this same timeframe, Huang became more widely known. In March 2024, Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Instagram with a picture of himself and Huang wearing each other's signature jacket: \"He's like Taylor Swift, but for tech\".\n\nIn June 2024, Nvidia's market capitalization reached for the first time and Huang's net worth grew to . By then, the news media was using the term \"Jensanity\" to refer to Huang's celebrity status in Taiwan, and it was compared to the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon of 2012. Huang was the center of attention at Computex 2024 in Taipei, even though he was not on the official speaking program. Large crowds of fans and paparazzi followed Huang and his family members around every time they appeared in public during their 2024 visit to Taiwan.\n\nIn January 2025, Huang delivered the keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. During this keynote, Huang made a number of announcements such as a new gaming chip called the GeForce RTX 50-series, new chips for both PCs and laptops, an agreement to provide Toyota self-driving vehicles with Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin supercomputer and operating system called DriveOS, and the release of Cosmos, a series of foundational AI models designed to support the development of self-driving cars, humanoid robots and industrial robots. In March 2025, Huang delivered the keynote at Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference, where he unveiled next-generation graphics architectures Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, announced the open-source Isaac GR00T N1 model for humanoid robots, and introduced the Newton physics engine for robotics simulation. He also predicted Nvidia's data center infrastructure revenue could reach $1 trillion by 2028 and announced new AI initiatives and partnerships, including collaboration with General Motors on autonomous vehicle AI systems.",

Prabowo is Indonesia's third president to have a military background after Suharto and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and is the oldest first-term president in Indonesian history.\n\nPrabowo Subianto graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy (Akademi Militer Nasional) in 1970 and primarily served in the Special Forces (Kopassus) until he was appointed to lead the Strategic Reserves Command (Kostrad) in 1998. Later that same year, he was discharged from the military and subsequently banned from entering the United States for allegedly committing human rights abuses.\n\nIn early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle established the Gerindra Party. In the 2009 presidential election, he ran unsuccessfully for the vice presidency as Megawati Sukarnoputri's running mate. He contested the 2014 presidential election and was defeated by Jakarta governor Joko Widodo, which he initially disputed. He made another unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2019 against Joko Widodo, with Sandiaga Uno as his running mate and with the support of Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Democratic Party (Demokrat) and Berkarya Party. His refusal to accept the result saw his followers stage protests that sparked deadly riots in Jakarta. However, after a heated contest, Prabowo Subianto joined Joko Widodo's cabinet as his minister of defense for the 2019 to 2024 period.\n\nOn 10 October 2021, Gerindra announced Prabowo as their candidate in the 2024 Indonesian presidential election.

On 20 March, the General Election Commission (KPU) certified the results and declared him as the president-elect of Indonesia. The Constitutional Court (MK) confirmed his status on 22 April 2024. Prabowo was sworn in as the 8th president of Indonesia on 20 October 2024. In January 2025, he launched the Free Nutritious Meals program, aiming to provide free meals to Indonesian students and targeting over 85 million children and pregnant women by the end of the year.

        "agent_updated_section": "As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring. He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one. James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense. Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds. In January 2025, James demonstrated his continued versatility and athleticism with a left-handed windmill dunk, highlighting his ability to perform spectacular plays and maintain a high level of offensive prowess during the 2024\u20132025 NBA season.\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team. His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history. By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses, he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists. James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters. Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games; however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.",

In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot. In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions. From the years 2012\u20132016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014\u201315 NBA season. Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching. James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\". He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".
